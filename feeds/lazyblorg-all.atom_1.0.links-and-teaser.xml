Today I finally took the time to figure to the YASnippet Emacs package to create a template for my new blogposts. Turns out there was not a lot to understand. To create a new template you run `M-x` `yas-new-snippet`. In the then opening buffer you just enter your template in plain text and hit `C-c C-c` when you're done.

</p>


<p>

The three other elements that I needed for my simple snippets:

</p>

<ul>
<li>`$0` denotes where the cursor should end up after the snippet is inserted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Emacs lisp code to be evaluated with the snipped can be inserted within backquotes. Example: the following snippet enters the current date in iso-format:</li>
</ul>


	  <div class="example_code">
	  <pre>`(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")` $0	  </pre>
    </div>

<ul>
<li>Elements to be completed at point are entered with {N: default value} as an example here is the template for a for-loop in C:</li>
</ul>


<p>

  #+begin_src C

</p>


<p>

for (${1:i = 0}; ${2:i &lt; N}; ${3:i++}) { $0 }

</p>


<p>

  #+end_src

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>

My second semester has just ended and I've been reflecting on my goals for the last 1.5 years. While rereading [Finding your people](<a href="https://guzey.com/personal/friendship/)">https://guzey.com/personal/friendship/)</a> and other peoples reflections on college there is this theme: “Try to not settle for the local optimum of always hanging out with the people you happen to stumble into, but to actively optimize for meeting awesome people.“ While reading these I felt like "Yes this feels like something important, but how do you actually optimize for this in practice?". As always with these things I feel like the best way would probably asking other people for help, but this is so scarry so I might as well worry about it The things written below are just me brainstorming on the topic, so I apologize if more people end up reading this. I haven’t heavily optimized this for readability, but hope this is still helpful for other people.

</p>

<ul>
<li>But how do you even optimize for meeting (awesome) people?
<ul>
<li>Looking back on the last 1.5 year
<ul>
<li>What worked
<ul>
<li>I found an accountability partner by actively searching! At some points one of my desperate attempts just ended up working! (Let's see for how long this goes!)</li>
<li>Ask my accountability guy for advice about meeting people?</li>
<li>My local rationality group</li>
<li>There is a bunch of awesome people I interacted for a short while through coworking online, which were always exceptionally well fit people concerned about the same things as I was.</li>
<li>I think one thing that went really great was focusmate. If there is one thing were I want to congratulate past me with following through, then it is probably doing the coworking sessions on focusmate even though my chest was pounding like crazy and I felt like embarrassing myself in front of these awesome people doing important stuff every time. I don't think my smalltalk/de-awkwarding skills improved lots during these sessions, but I feel like my head slowly accepted that these very short situations with strangers end up slightly awkward not only because people are focused on a different goal (getting their work done.)
<ul>
<li>So if you just like me feel very frightened and awkward during your first meetings on focusmate and feel like they might not be worth it on balance, if that is always how you feel about them. Then I want to nudge you by this n=1 evidence that this feeling is probably going to decline. Yay!</li>
<li>I feel like on the one hand I should probably follow up with some of the really intruiging people I met there. At the same time I don't want to degrade the quality of the whole website and it is nice that people there are there not "just" for "<code>networking</code>".</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Going to big parties and just settling in a random place, introducing myself while not interrupting people actively in their conversations went great when I literally didn't know anyone. Problem there haven't been that many parties like this or I haven't been invited to them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What did not work
<ul>
<li>Online dating. None of my days this years have been as miserable than the days were I set up my online dating accounts and tried to compose my bio or write messages to people. There is not a single person who I ended up meeting.
<ul>
<li>Yes I know… Maybe if I was being more strategic the whole thing would work, but I feel this is an area where I again and again failed with the "trying harder" approach. Yes my photos suck! I took some selfies outside. I did not go as far as asking a friend to take some photos with me AND then actually following through with that (because it felt super awkward the ~4 times I pitched this to a friend in conversation and I kind of waited for them to say "yes" lets do that (which of course never happened).)
<ul>
<li>I did not go as far as buying better looking clothes because I think without someone who has actual taste in this I would not be doing particularly better than with the clothes largely optimized for convencience and "unauffällig" averageness I have now.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the current situation?
<ul>
<li>There is about ~10-20 people I talk to during a regular week would be my guess. Maybe half of that are actually meaningful interactions. The amount of new people entering my life per week might be around 1-3 depending on how deep of an interaction counts. (I just reflected on the last party I went to and I think the average one I went to still doubled the amount of new people I met per week with maybe slightly worse interactions?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the current bottleneck?
<ul>
<li>Things that come to my mind related to this</li>
<li>Am I just lazy, do I need to invest more time in this than I would naively like to?</li>
<li>Is my social anxiety one of the limiting factors, and there are all of these opportunities — like talking to the other people in the studying room when you take a break — that I am missing out on?</li>
<li>Do I need to accept that the current</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What should I even optimize for?
<ul>
<li>What is the right balance between:
<ul>
<li>Meeting people in AI-Alignment because this seems like an important area?</li>
<li>Meeting people in the whole intellectuals sphere EA/ People in the US compared to people around here?
<ul>
<li>How would I make best guesses in this Area?</li>
<li>Should I ask some people explicitly who have probably thought more about this?
<ul>
<li>[?] Like the australian guy?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>I feel like my experience doing this has been mixed and it just generally feels very hard to do that
<ul>
<li>I am already not the kind of person who likes to always go on parties, but I went to way more bar nights in my dorm than I would have if not explicitly thinking about explore vs exploit dynamics
<ul>
<li>These bar nights are dominated by the same kind of people often though. The big parties are things like people partying after their exams. That feels like the kind of events you want to be at, but first I don't really know how to hear about them, if it is not my major (I guess this is intentional?)
<ul>
<li>At the same time corona adds this second layer of ambigouity because I think the current situation is rather ridiculus with 97% of students at my university being vaccinated, but really huge parties would still probably be a thing to avoid? My strategy so far had mostly been just going more with my antisocial side, so I wouldn't have to think about the pandemic.
<ul>
<li>It also adds this layer where it makes it hard to talk with other people about this stuff because you don't want to seem like the reckless person.
<ul>
<li>Am I being reckless? Maybe I do not have the right perspective on this? To be honest I am just really tired of this whole thing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wait!!! While writing this I was thinking that it should be trivially easy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<b>Pure curiosity</b>

</p>


<p>

I recently realized why some I find board games/puzzles boring after a while:

</p>


<p>

The returns on "cognition" for these games has a sharp cutoff.

</p>


<p>

<a href="tsfile:/home/tassilo/Pictures/2018-04/IMG_2856.JPG">tsfile:/home/tassilo/Pictures/2018-04/IMG_2856.JPG</a> While this seems a bit obvious in retrospect, I haven't seen anyone talk about "returns on cognition" in any other context apart from thinking about AI-Doom scenarios.

</p>


<p>

One thing that always made me a bit frustrated with different board games is that a lot of them get boring once you've played a few times, and there are a lot of heuristics that are obviously close to optimal play. Other games really encourage me to "actually think", because there are highly non-obvious situations coming up all the time.

</p>


<p>

One example for a game that is boring is 2048 (or at least doesn't encourage more than executing a fairly trivial algorithm). Once you have figured out you always need to put the big numbers in the corner. But there is a close cousin of this game <a href="Dive][https://alexfink.github.io/dive/">Dive][https://alexfink.github.io/dive/</a> where you can merge the numbers if one is a multiple of the other. For Dive I don't have any good heuristics like this, and it feels more engaging for that reason.

</p>


<p>

Interesting concept I stumbled upon while googling:

</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity</a></em>: the Wikipedia-article goes into a lot of different measures for how hard it is to play a game optimally</li>

Was ich mich schon gefragt habe, ist wie lazyblorg denn mehrere Sprachen bei den Blogposts unterstützt. Ich hatte mich in der Hinsicht gewundert, weil ich dafür keinen Tag setzen musste oder ähnliches. Nachdem ich <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg/wiki/Tags">im Wiki</a> mehr zu tags gelesen habe bin ich darüber gestolpert, dass lazyblorg von Haus aus einfach nach Keywords sucht, um die Sprache zuzuordnen. Das ganze gefällt mir mehr und mehr!

</p>

<ul>
<li>Als nächstes frage ich mich natürlich, ob bulletpoints funktionieren
<ul>
<li>Das wäre schon ein Feature, das ich die ganze Zeit verwenden würde.</li>
<li>Sieht so aus als würde es ziemlich Einwandfrei funktionieren.
<ul>
<li>Aber wie weit geht es rein in die Hierarchie?</li>

While I enjoy journaling in Emacs and, asking oneself the same questions every day becomes boring for me really quickly. My new solution is to give myself a random prompt from a list of nice introspective questions I stole from <a href="https://clearerthinking.org">https://clearerthinking.org</a>[fn:2] . This is pretty easily implemented in Elisp [fn:1]:

</p>


	  <div class="example_code">
	  <pre>;list with your prompts
(setq custom/journal-prompts '("What is on your mind?"
                               "What did you achieve today?"
                               "What worried you today?"))
(defun custom/random-phrase ()
  "command to insert prompt at cursor"
    (interactive)
    (insert (seq-random-elt custom/journal-prompts)))	  </pre>
    </div>


<p>

Happy random journaling!

Right after <a href="//sonofhypnos.github.io/thoughts/2022/01/19/19-01-2022-first-post">creating my blog with Lazyblorg</a>, I had a hard time using Emacs to write my Blogposts instead of just using the markdown editor on <a href="https://lesswrong.com">lesswrong</a>. Truth is Emacs isn't the perfect writing environment for me yet, but it is slowly getting to that point. What was bugging me the most, was the lacking linting and spellchecking through LanguageTool that I've grown accustomed to in the browser. By now I figured out that I had disabled the default flycheck features, which are actually rather neat and very good at identifying my mistakes. I've now actually taken the time to configure LanguageTool. I suddenly realized that this also solved my other problem, which was getting rid of meta-comments in the final versions of my blogposts. For now, I can just add the TODO keyword and flycheck will remind me, that this should probably be removed at some point. Next I've installed LanguageTool on my system, so I could get the superb corrections not only in the browser, but in Emacs as well. Hussa!

I recently stumbled upon <a href="https://futureoflife.org/2020/01/31/fli-podcast-identity-information-the-nature-of-reality-with-anthony-aguirre/">this episode</a> of the future of life institute podcast on "the nature of reality" and keep coming back to thinking about it. I am still not sure whether to take this whole thing as basically trivial or whether I should go into full blown believe crisis mode. Now that I am thinking about it I already have a full blown believe crisis (maybe <a href="https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2016/10/28/insight-porn/">insight ornanating</a> would be a better description?). In contrast to my regular believe crisis, while I definitely feel like this view should in some sense change how I think about the world/base reality there is another part that is just really reluctant to accept yet another complication in how I think about the world. I just can't manage to find anything in particular that is different from this view compared to my previous view, except when I apply it to topics like consciousness or the nature of computation that make me really confused anyways. If you are reading this none of this is probably really "new". It is just like someone is spelling out this view that I've sometimes seen people gesture at, but he is more explicit about it.

</p>


<blockquote> Quantum mechanics does say that there are particles in a sense, like you can say that there are particles but particles aren’t really the thing. You can ask questions of reality that entail that reality is made of particles and you will get answers that look like answers about particles. But you can also ask questions about the same physical system about how it is as a wave and you will get answers about how it is as a wave. And in general in quantum mechanics, there are all sorts of questions that you can ask and you will get answers about the physical system in the terms that you asked those questions about. So as long as it is a sort of well-defined physical experiment that you can do and that you can translate into a kind of mathematical form, what does it mean to do that experiment? Quantum mechanics gives you a way to compute predictions for how that experiment will turn out without really taking a particular view on what that physical system is, is it a particle? Is it a wave? Or is it something else? And I think this is important to note, it’s not just that quantum mechanics says that things are particles and waves at the same time, it’s that they’re all sorts of things at the same time.<br />
So you can ask how much of my phone is an elephant in quantum mechanics. A phone is totally not the same thing as an elephant, but a phone has a wave function, so if I knew the wave function of the phone and I knew a procedure for asking, “Is something an elephant?”, then I could apply that procedure to the phone and the answer would not be, “No, the phone is definitely not an elephant.” The answer would be, “The phone is a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny bit an elephant.” So this is very exaggerated because we’re talking phones and elephants, all these numbers are so tiny. But the point is that I can interrogate reality in quantum mechanics in many different ways. I can formulate whatever questions I want and it will give me answers in terms of those questions.</blockquote>


<p>

I had been already familiar with the idea that quantum mechanics adds a probabilistic element to your whole world model, that there is basically that whole class of things that are "possible" like a baseball suddenly being in front of you, but the probability being essentially so small that it does not matter (not to mention that quantum effects of your own perception/brain totally dominating the equation: Most worlds where there is suddenly a baseball moving without anything before happening, there is some "classical" mechanic explanation and even when we get to the quantum, explanations, most of those would at least in the baseball example be misfirings in my brain (both because of the great mass of a baseball and the specificness of a baseball, that would probably be better explained by some misfiring in my brain (since otherwise where are all the indistinguishable blobs?))). What was new to me was to basically put the limits of what you are actually able to observe on some kind of pedestal as the only thing that really matters in some sense.

</p>


<blockquote>You can say in Newtonian mechanics or classical physics, there’s something arguably reasonable about saying, “Here is the system, it’s these particles and they’re moving around in this way.” And that’s saying something. I think you can argue about whether that’s actually true, that that’s saying something. But you can talk about the particles themselves in a fairly meaningful way without talking about the observer or the person who’s measuring it or something like that. Whereas in quantum mechanics, it’s really fairly useless to talk about the wave function of something without talking about the way that you measure things or the basis that you operate it on and so on.
[...]
So this is a conception of reality that’s kind of like a big game of 20 questions. Every time we look out at reality, we’re just asking different questions of it. Normally we’re narrowing down the possibility space of how reality is by asking those questions, getting answers to it. To me a really interesting question is like, what is the ontological reality status of all those big sets of questions that we’re asking? Your tendency as a theoretical physicist is to say, “Oh, the wave function is the thing that’s real and that’s what actually exists, and all these extra things are just extra things that we made up and our globbed onto the wave function.” But I think that’s kind of a very impoverished view of reality, not just impoverished, but completely useless and empty of any utility or meaning because quantum mechanics by its nature requires both parts. The questions and the state. If you cut out all the questions, you’re just left with this very empty thing that has no applicability or meaning.</blockquote>


<p>

It also reminded me of Scott Garrabrant’s perspective on inference with <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/kxs3eeEti9ouwWFzr/p/N5Jm6Nj4HkNKySA5Z">finite factored sets</a>. I am not sure I really understood that either though.

Today I finally managed to get a blogging setup with orgmode working. This has honestly been one of my more stressful projects so far. According to my timetracking data, I have spent at least 26 hours tinkering with different solutions, sweating over whether I should go anonymous or not, whether to continue to use my <a href="https://github.com/sonofhypnos/blog">jekyll setup</a> and other overwhelming details.

<p>

In the end I decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a>. While <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a> promises to make blogging low effort, therefore making blogging a sustainable habit for me, it is definitely not the easiest solution to set up in the first place. I had already once tried to use it, but must have gotten stuck at some point that I don't even remember anymore. It still took me 4 hours yesterday to go from "Ok lets finally do this", to now where I managed to create this blogpost and be able to see it in the browser. I am honestly not quite sure what took me so long, but one thing that definitely was tricky, was getting all of the meta-data right, that is required for a blogpost. Things I have allowed to put off for now is tweaking the CSS file, fixing the broken Header of the webpage or removing the example blogposts.
