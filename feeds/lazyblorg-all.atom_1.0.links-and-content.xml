Today I finally managed to get a working blogging setup with orgmode working. This has honestly been one of my more stressful projects so far. According to my timetracking data, I have spent at least 26 hours tinkering with different solutions, sweating over whether I should go anonymous or not, whether to continue to use my <a href="https://github.com/sonofhypnos/blog">jekyll setup</a> and other overwhelming details.

</p>


<p>

In the end I decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a>.

</p>


<p>

While <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a> promises to make blogging low effort, therefore making blogging a sustainable habit for me, it is definitely not the easiest solution to set up in the first place. I had already once tried to use it, but must have gotten stuck at some point that I don't even remember anymore. It still took me 4 hours yesterday to go from "Ok lets finally do this", to now where I managed to create this blogpost and be able to see it in the browser. I am honestly not quite sure what took me so long, but one thing that definitely was tricky, was getting all of the meta-data right, that is required for a blogpost. Things I have allowed to put off for now is tweaking the CSS file, fixing the broken Header of the webpage or removing the example blogposts.
