After watching this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aolI_Rz0ZqY][excellent video on more advanced and new things in git]], I decided to setup signing my git commands through ssh.

That is easily done through:
#+begin_src sh
ssk-keygen -f ~/.ssh/git
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/git
#+end_src

Next I got a bit concerned though, because so far I had always just taken for granted that I might loose my ssh-keys if I start using a different device. I have backups and all, but it seemed prudent to put these into my password Manager also (I use 1password, because I started with that, but today I'd probably choose bitwarden instead as it's open source).

You can add your ssh-key programmatically to 1password like so:
#+begin_src sh
op item create --category=ssh-key --title="$key_name" \
    --vault='Private' --session="$OP_SESSION" \
    "Keys.private[password]=$private_key_content" \
    "Keys.public[concealed]=$public_key_content"
#+end_src
