This document is for small ideas similar to the lw shortform feature
- Keyboard shortcuts are great. But figuring out how to set them well for applications or across applications I care about is really annoying.
  - I now have a [[https://github.com/sonofhypnos/my-keyboard-layout/tree/main][keyboard map]] to document my current layout for window-manager shorcuts
  - How do I manage collisions between english and German keyboards?
    - Problematic keys:
      "[", "]", "\" and "/" are accessible without a modifier key on english keyboards and key combinations involving them tend to not work with a german keyboard layout
  - What my current setup looks like (and how this factors into things)
    - Operating system
      - Browser/Firefox
        - Trydactyl (for vim keybinds and much more inside the browser)
          - webapps
          - specific websites
      - Text-Editor
      - Other Applications
  - Different platforms have different keyboard shortcut philosophy sets.
    - VSCode vs Emacs vs. Vim
  - Example: Different
  - Story:
  - link: gwern has an interesting take on this.
