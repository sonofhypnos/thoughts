** DONE Game complexity is interesting, but what I would find even more interesting, whether this is directly related to the diminishing returns on more cognition in a game :blog:

*Pure curiosity*

I recently realized why some I find board games/puzzles boring after a while:

The returns on "cognition" for these games has a sharp cutoff.

While this seems a bit obvious in retrospect, I haven't seen anyone talk about "returns on cognition" in any other context apart from thinking about AI-Doom scenarios.

One thing that always made me a bit frustrated with different board games is that a lot of them get boring once you've played a few times, and there are a lot of heuristics that are obviously close to optimal play. Other games really encourage me to "actually think", because there are highly non-obvious situations coming up all the time.

One example for a game that is boring is 2048 (or at least doesn't encourage more than executing a fairly trivial algorithm). Once you have figured out you always need to put the big numbers in the corner. But there is a close cousin of this game [[Dive][https://alexfink.github.io/dive/]] where you can merge the numbers if one is a multiple of the other. For Dive I don't have any good heuristics like this, and it feels more engaging for that reason.

Interesting concept I stumbled upon while googling:
- [[game complexity][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity]]: the Wikipedia-article goes into a lot of different measures for how hard it is to play a game optimally
