Today I want to show you the amazing device that ran my life for...3 years? It's this smart watch:

The specific model is the ZGPAX S8. My father got it gifted at a conference and gave it to me after finding no use for it. First I uninstalled all the useless apps on it and installed the Nova Launcher.

** What I used the watch for:


  - Timetracking
    - On the main screen you can see the main categories that I tracked with this watch. Starting to track a category only needed three clicks. 1 to get to the home screen and two to select the category to track.
  - Timers
    - The multitimer app on the homescreen is very useful for pomodoros
    - The left app on the homescreen is also a timer app that I used for arbitrary time-intervals when I did not want to forget something.


** Search for a replacement


To this day I haven't found a more convenient way to run my timers and timetracking. By now I am just using the same apps on my phone. It's less convenient, but unfortunately Google stopped supporting the android version of this watch. I tried getting a new one, but it's hard to get full-android watches. I just recently bought a watch for 250â‚¬ ([[https://store.rogbid.com/products/brave3][the Brave3]]), because I thought it would be able to support this workflow, but for some reason I was then not able to run the playstore on it (it just crashed). I also tried using the [[https://www.amazon.de/KOSPET-Smartwatch-HD-Touchscreen-Gesicht-ID-Herzfrequenzmessung-Schwarz/dp/B08S72N562?th=1][Kospet note]]. [[ https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/ypl7yh/do_square_full_android_watches_that_are_small/][It successfully ran my apps]], it was just so large it hurt my wrist.
