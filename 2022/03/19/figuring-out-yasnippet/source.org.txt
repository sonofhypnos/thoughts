Today I finally took the time to figure to the YASnippet Emacs package to create a template for my new blogposts. Turns out there was not a lot to understand. To create a new template you run `M-x` `yas-new-snippet`. In the then opening buffer you just enter your template in plain text and hit `C-c C-c` when you're done.

The three other elements that I needed for my simple snippets:

- `$0` denotes where the cursor should end up after the snippet is inserted.

- Emacs lisp code to be evaluated with the snipped can be inserted within backquotes.
  Example: the following snippet enters the current date in iso-format:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
`(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")` $0
#+end_src


- Elements to be completed at point are entered with {N: default value} as an example here is the template for a for-loop in C:

#+begin_src c :tangle yes
for (${1:i = 0}; ${2:i < N}; ${3:i++}) {
    $0
        }
#+end_src
