Right after [[id:ca493f40-fe93-4610-b3d7][creating my blog with Lazyblorg]], I actually had a hard time actually using Emacs to write my Blogposts instead of just using the markdown editor in [[https://lesswrong.com][lesswrong]]. Truth is Emacs isn't the perfect writing environment for me yet, but it is slowly getting to that point. What was bugging me the most, was the lacking linting and spellchecking through LanguageTool that I've grown accustomed to in the browser. By now I figured out that I had disabled the default flycheck features, which are actually rather neat and very good at identifying my mistakes. I've now actually taken the time to configure LanguageTool. I suddenly realized that this also solved my other problem, which was getting rid of meta-comments in the final versions of my blogposts. For now I can just add the TODO keyword and flycheck will remind me, that this should probably be removed at some point. Next I've installed LanguageTool on my system so I could get the superb corrections not only in the browser, but in emacs as well. Hussa!
