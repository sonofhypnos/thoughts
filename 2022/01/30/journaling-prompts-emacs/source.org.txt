While I really like journaling in Emacs and I really like the daily prompts I've set up for that, asking oneself the same questions every day becomes boring for me really quickly. My new solution is to give myself a random prompt from a list of nice introspective questions I stole from [[https://clearerthinking.org]][fn:2] . This is pretty easily implemented in Elisp [fn:1]:
#+begin_src elisp
;list with your prompts
(setq custom/journal-prompts '("What is on your mind?"
                               "What did you achieve today"
                               "What worried you today"))
;command to insert prompt at cursor
(defun custom/random-phrase ()
    (interactive)
    (insert (seq-random-elt custom/journal-prompts)))
#+end_src
Happy random journaling!

[fn:2] If you are really curious, you can just take a look at [[https://github.com/sonofhypnos/emacs-config][my config]].

[fn:1]
In the beginning I had high aspirations by weighting how often I get to see a prompt by how useful it was, but this (at least so far) turned out to be an overengineered solution, because it's very easy to just generate a new prompt, so I did not bother with that in the end.
