While I really like journaling in Emacs and I really like the daily prompts I've set up for that, asking oneself the same questions every day becomes boring for me really quickly. My new solution is to give myself a random prompt from a list of nice introspective questions I stole from [[https://clearerthinking.org]]. This is pretty easy to implement in elisp [fn:1]:
#+begin_src elisp
;list with your prompts
(setq custom/journal-prompts '("What is on your mind?"
                               "What did you achieve today"
                               "What worried you today"))
;command to insert prompt at cursor
(defun custom/random-phrase ()
    (interactive)
    (insert (seq-random-elt custom/journal-prompts)))
#+end_src
