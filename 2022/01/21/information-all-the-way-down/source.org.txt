** There has
I recently stumbled upon this interview on the future of humanity podcast on "the nature of reality" and keep coming back to thinking about it. I am still not sure whether to take this whole thing as basically trivial or whether I should go into full blown believe crisis mode. Now that I am thinking about it I already have a full blown believe crisis. Not that this would be really new to me as I was already in high school pretty drawn to the insightporn gained through reading popular science explanations of quantum mechanics.
The only thing that is different this time is that while I definitely feel like this view should in some sense change how I think about the world/base reality there is another part that is just really reluctant to accept yet another complication in how I think about how to solve epistemology. I just can't manage to find anything in particular that is diffrent from this view compared to my previous view. If you are reading this none of this is probably really "new" it is just like someone is spelling out this view that I've sometimes seen people gesture at, but he is more explicit about it.

 Quantum mechanics does say that there are particles in a sense, like you can say that there are particles but particles aren’t really the thing. You can ask questions of reality that entail that reality is made of particles and you will get answers that look like answers about particles. But you can also ask questions about the same physical system about how it is as a wave and you will get answers about how it is as a wave. And in general in quantum mechanics, there are all sorts of questions that you can ask and you will get answers about the physical system in the terms that you asked those questions about. So as long as it is a sort of well-defined physical experiment that you can do and that you can translate into a kind of mathematical form, what does it mean to do that experiment? Quantum mechanics gives you a way to compute predictions for how that experiment will turn out without really taking a particular view on what that physical system is, is it a particle? Is it a wave? Or is it something else? And I think this is important to note, it’s not just that quantum mechanics says that things are particles and waves at the same time, it’s that they’re all sorts of things at the same time.

So you can ask how much of my phone is an elephant in quantum mechanics. A phone is totally not the same thing as an elephant, but a phone has a wave function, so if I knew the wave function of the phone and I knew a procedure for asking, “Is something an elephant?”, then I could apply that procedure to the phone and the answer would not be, “No, the phone is definitely not an elephant.” The answer would be, “The phone is a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny bit an elephant.” So this is very exaggerated because we’re talking phones and elephants, all these numbers are so tiny. But the point is that I can interrogate reality in quantum mechanics in many different ways. I can formulate whatever questions I want and it will give me answers in terms of those questions.

*** If you ask the universe whether a telephone is an elephant, you'll always get an answer that says "phone is a tiny bit an elephant" (implicitly added of course to the whole ambigouity/uncertainty in how we assign concepts about real world phenomena in general (and how you can deeply confuse yourself with words))
**** Baseball and quantum mechanics
:PROPERTIES:
:END:
I had been already familiar with this idea, that there is basically that whole class of things like a baseball suddenly being in front of you, but the probability being essentially so tiny to not matter (and also so small that things like quantum weirdness of your own perception/brain totally dominating the equation: Most worlds where there is suddenly a baseball moving without anything before happening, there is some ["classical" mechanic explanation](like with the shampoo), and even when we get to the quantum, explanations, most of those would at least in the baseball example be misfirings in your own brain (both because of the great mass of a baseball and the specificness of a baseball, that would probably be better explained by some misfiring in your brain (since otherwise where are all the indistinguishable mass blobs?)))

Lucas Perry: Can you unpack a little bit that quantum uncertainty and weirdness that explains, when you ask questions to quantum mechanics, you don’t ever get definite answers? Is that right?

[[id:c8ec8062-e0a2-4010-8981-41e3e22c7dbc][Anthony Aguirre]]: Almost Never [...] That is if you have a quantum system, there is a particular set of questions that you can ask it that you will get definite answers to and the quantum state essentially is that set of questions. When you say an electron is here and it has this spin that is, it’s rotating around this direction, what you really mean is that there are a particular set of questions like, “Where are you? And what is your spin?” That if you asked them of this electron, you would get a definite answer.

It’s sort of like you’ve got a very, very particularly shaped net and you can cast it on something and if the thing happens to have exactly the right shape, your net just falls right over it and it doesn’t affect the thing at all and you say, “Oh, it has that property.” But if it has any other shape, then your net kind of messes it up, it gets perturbed and you catch something in your net. The net is your experiment, but you mess up the system while you’re doing it, but it’s not that you necessarily mess up the system, it’s that you’re asking it a question that it isn’t ready to answer definitively, but rather some other question.

So this is always true, but it’s kind of the crucial thing of reality. But the crucial thing about quantum mechanics is that that list is finite. We’re used to asking any question that… I’ve got a mug, I can ask, “Is it brown? Is it here? Is it there? How heavy?” Whatever question I think of, I feel like I can answer. I can ask the question and there will be an answer to it because whatever question I ask, if it’s a well-defined question before I ask it, the mug either has that property or it doesn’t. But quantum mechanics tells us that is true. But there’s only a finite number of answers there are built in to the object. And I can ask other questions, but I just can’t expect the answer to already be there in the sense that I’ll get a definite answer to it.

** Some discussion how this is related to observation entails in the end with:


#+begin_quote
And I think that is something that’s a little bit different. You can say in Newtonian mechanics or classical physics, there’s something arguably reasonable about saying, “Here is the system, it’s these particles and they’re moving around in this way.” And that’s saying something. I think you can argue about whether that’s actually true, that that’s saying something. But you can talk about the particles themselves in a fairly meaningful way without talking about the observer or the person who’s measuring it or something like that. Whereas in quantum mechanics, it’s really fairly useless to talk about the wave function of something without talking about the way that you measure things or the basis that you operate it on and so on.
[...]
So this is a conception of reality that’s kind of like a big game of 20 questions. Every time we look out at reality, we’re just asking different questions of it. Normally we’re narrowing down the possibility space of how reality is by asking those questions, getting answers to it. To me a really interesting question is like, what is the ontological reality status of all those big sets of questions that we’re asking? Your tendency as a theoretical physicist is to say, “Oh, the wave function is the thing that’s real and that’s what actually exists, and all these extra things are just extra things that we made up and our globbed onto the wave function.” But I think that’s kind of a very impoverished view of reality, not just impoverished, but completely useless and empty of any utility or meaning because quantum mechanics by its nature requires both parts. The questions and the state. If you cut out all the questions, you’re just left with this very empty thing that has no applicability or meaning.

** The whole view expressed here very much reminds me of Scott Garrabrant’s framing of inference with Finite Factored Sets.
