<p>My second semester has just ended and I've been reflecting on my goals
for the last 1.5 years. While rereading [Finding your
people](<a href="https://guzey.com/personal/friendship/">https://guzey.com/personal/friendship/</a>) and other peoples
reflections on college there is this theme: "Try to not settle for the
local optimum of always hanging out with the people you happen to
stumble into, but to actively optimize for meeting awesome people."
While reading these I felt like \"Yes this feels like something
important, but how do you actually optimize for this in practice?\". As
always with these things I feel like the best way would probably asking
other people for help, but this is so scarry so I might as well worry
about it The things written below are just me brainstorming on the
topic, so I apologize if more people end up reading this. I haven't
heavily optimized this for readability, but hope this is still helpful
for other people.</p>
<ul>
<li>But how do you even optimize for meeting (awesome) people?<ul>
<li>Looking back on the last 1.5 year<ul>
<li>What worked<ul>
<li>I found an accountability partner by actively searching!
    At some points one of my desperate attempts just ended
    up working! (Let's see for how long this goes!)</li>
<li>Ask my accountability guy for advice about meeting
    people?</li>
<li>My local rationality group</li>
<li>There is a bunch of awesome people I interacted for a
    short while through coworking online, which were always
    exceptionally well fit people concerned about the same
    things as I was.</li>
<li>I think one thing that went really great was focusmate.
    If there is one thing were I want to congratulate past
    me with following through, then it is probably doing the
    coworking sessions on focusmate even though my chest was
    pounding like crazy and I felt like embarrassing myself
    in front of these awesome people doing important stuff
    every time. I don't think my smalltalk/de-awkwarding
    skills improved lots during these sessions, but I feel
    like my head slowly accepted that these very short
    situations with strangers end up slightly awkward not
    only because people are focused on a different goal
    (getting their work done.)<ul>
<li>So if you just like me feel very frightened and
    awkward during your first meetings on focusmate and
    feel like they might not be worth it on balance, if
    that is always how you feel about them. Then I want
    to nudge you by this n=1 evidence that this feeling
    is probably going to decline. Yay!</li>
<li>I feel like on the one hand I should probably follow
    up with some of the really intruiging people I met
    there. At the same time I don't want to degrade the
    quality of the whole website and it is nice that
    people there are there not \"just\" for
    \"<code>networking</code>\".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Going to big parties and just settling in a random
    place, introducing myself while not interrupting people
    actively in their conversations went great when I
    literally didn't know anyone. Problem there haven't
    been that many parties like this or I haven't been
    invited to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What did not work<ul>
<li>Online dating. None of my days this years have been as
    miserable than the days were I set up my online dating
    accounts and tried to compose my bio or write messages
    to people. There is not a single person who I ended up
    meeting.<ul>
<li>Yes I know... Maybe if I was being more strategic
    the whole thing would work, but I feel this is an
    area where I again and again failed with the
    \"trying harder\" approach. Yes my photos suck! I
    took some selfies outside. I did not go as far as
    asking a friend to take some photos with me AND then
    actually following through with that (because it
    felt super awkward the \~4 times I pitched this to a
    friend in conversation and I kind of waited for them
    to say \"yes\" lets do that (which of course never
    happened).)<ul>
<li>I did not go as far as buying better looking
    clothes because I think without someone who has
    actual taste in this I would not be doing
    particularly better than with the clothes
    largely optimized for convencience and
    \"unauffällig\" averageness I have now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the current situation?<ul>
<li>There is about \~10-20 people I talk to during a regular
    week would be my guess. Maybe half of that are actually
    meaningful interactions. The amount of new people entering
    my life per week might be around 1-3 depending on how deep
    of an interaction counts. (I just reflected on the last
    party I went to and I think the average one I went to still
    doubled the amount of new people I met per week with maybe
    slightly worse interactions?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the current bottleneck?<ul>
<li>Things that come to my mind related to this</li>
<li>Am I just lazy, do I need to invest more time in this than I
    would naively like to?</li>
<li>Is my social anxiety one of the limiting factors, and there
    are all of these opportunities --- like talking to the other
    people in the studying room when you take a break --- that I
    am missing out on?</li>
<li>Do I need to accept that the current</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should I even optimize for?<ul>
<li>What is the right balance between:<ul>
<li>Meeting people in AI-Alignment because this seems like
    an important area?</li>
<li>Meeting people in the whole intellectuals sphere EA/
    People in the US compared to people around here?<ul>
<li>How would I make best guesses in this Area?</li>
<li>Should I ask some people explicitly who have
    probably thought more about this?<ul>
<li>[?] Like the australian guy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I feel like my experience doing this has been mixed and it just
    generally feels very hard to do that<ul>
<li>I am already not the kind of person who likes to always go on
    parties, but I went to way more bar nights in my dorm than I
    would have if not explicitly thinking about explore vs exploit
    dynamics<ul>
<li>These bar nights are dominated by the same kind of people
    often though. The big parties are things like people
    partying after their exams. That feels like the kind of
    events you want to be at, but first I don't really know how
    to hear about them, if it is not my major (I guess this is
    intentional?)<ul>
<li>At the same time corona adds this second layer of
    ambigouity because I think the current situation is
    rather ridiculus with 97% of students at my university
    being vaccinated, but really huge parties would still
    probably be a thing to avoid? My strategy so far had
    mostly been just going more with my antisocial side, so
    I wouldn't have to think about the pandemic.<ul>
<li>It also adds this layer where it makes it hard to
    talk with other people about this stuff because you
    don't want to seem like the reckless person.<ul>
<li>Am I being reckless? Maybe I do not have the
    right perspective on this? To be honest I am
    just really tired of this whole thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wait!!! While writing this I was thinking that it should
    be trivially easy</li>
</ul>
</li>
