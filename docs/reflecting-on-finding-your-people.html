        <div class="post-content"><p>My second semester has just ended and I've been reflecting on my goals
for the last 1.5 years. While rereading [Finding your
people](<a href="https://guzey.com/personal/friendship/">https://guzey.com/personal/friendship/</a>) and other peoples
reflections on college there is this theme: "Try to not settle for the
local optimum of always hanging out with the people you happen to
stumble into, but to actively optimize for meeting awesome people."
While reading these I felt like "Yes this feels like something
important, but how do you actually optimize for this in practice?". As
always with these things I feel like the best way would probably asking
other people for help, but this is so scarry so I might as well worry
about it The things written below are just me brainstorming on the
topic, so I apologize if more people end up reading this. I haven't
heavily optimized this for readability, but hope this is still helpful
for other people.</p>
<ul>
<li>But how do you even optimize for meeting (awesome) people?<ul>
<li>Looking back on the last 1.5 year<ul>
<li>What worked<ul>
<li>I found an accountability partner by actively searching!
    At some points one of my desperate attempts just ended
    up working! (Let's see for how long this goes!)</li>
<li>Ask my accountability guy for advice about meeting
    people?</li>
<li>My local rationality group</li>
<li>There is a bunch of awesome people I interacted for a
    short while through coworking online, which were always
    exceptionally well fit people concerned about the same
    things as I was.</li>
<li>I think one thing that went really great was focusmate.
    If there is one thing were I want to congratulate past
    me with following through, then it is probably doing the
    coworking sessions on focusmate even though my chest was
    pounding like crazy and I felt like embarrassing myself
    in front of these awesome people doing important stuff
    every time. I don't think my smalltalk/de-awkwarding
    skills improved lots during these sessions, but I feel
    like my head slowly accepted that these very short
    situations with strangers end up slightly awkward not
    only because people are focused on a different goal
    (getting their work done.)<ul>
<li>So if you just like me feel very frightened and
    awkward during your first meetings on focusmate and
    feel like they might not be worth it on balance, if
    that is always how you feel about them. Then I want
    to nudge you by this n=1 evidence that this feeling
    is probably going to decline. Yay!</li>
<li>I feel like on the one hand I should probably follow
    up with some of the really intruiging people I met
    there. At the same time I don't want to degrade the
    quality of the whole website and it is nice that
    people there are there not "just" for
    "<code>networking</code>".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Going to big parties and just settling in a random
    place, introducing myself while not interrupting people
    actively in their conversations went great when I
    literally didn't know anyone. Problem there haven't
    been that many parties like this or I haven't been
    invited to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What did not work<ul>
<li>Online dating. None of my days this years have been as
    miserable than the days were I set up my online dating
    accounts and tried to compose my bio or write messages
    to people. There is not a single person who I ended up
    meeting.<ul>
<li>Yes I know... Maybe if I was being more strategic
    the whole thing would work, but I feel this is an
    area where I again and again failed with the
    "trying harder" approach. Yes my photos suck! I
    took some selfies outside. I did not go as far as
    asking a friend to take some photos with me AND then
    actually following through with that (because it
    felt super awkward the \~4 times I pitched this to a
    friend in conversation and I kind of waited for them
    to say "yes" lets do that (which of course never
    happened).)<ul>
<li>I did not go as far as buying better looking
    clothes because I think without someone who has
    actual taste in this I would not be doing
    particularly better than with the clothes
    largely optimized for convencience and
    "unauffällig" averageness I have now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the current situation?<ul>
<li>There is about \~10-20 people I talk to during a regular
    week would be my guess. Maybe half of that are actually
    meaningful interactions. The amount of new people entering
    my life per week might be around 1-3 depending on how deep
    of an interaction counts. (I just reflected on the last
    party I went to and I think the average one I went to still
    doubled the amount of new people I met per week with maybe
    slightly worse interactions?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the current bottleneck?<ul>
<li>Things that come to my mind related to this</li>
<li>Am I just lazy, do I need to invest more time in this than I
    would naively like to?</li>
<li>Is my social anxiety one of the limiting factors, and there
    are all of these opportunities --- like talking to the other
    people in the studying room when you take a break --- that I
    am missing out on?</li>
<li>Do I need to accept that the current</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should I even optimize for?<ul>
<li>What is the right balance between:<ul>
<li>Meeting people in AI-Alignment because this seems like
    an important area?</li>
<li>Meeting people in the whole intellectuals sphere EA/
    People in the US compared to people around here?<ul>
<li>How would I make best guesses in this Area?</li>
<li>Should I ask some people explicitly who have
    probably thought more about this?<ul>
<li>[?] Like the australian guy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I feel like my experience doing this has been mixed and it just
    generally feels very hard to do that<ul>
<li>I am already not the kind of person who likes to always go on
    parties, but I went to way more bar nights in my dorm than I
    would have if not explicitly thinking about explore vs exploit
    dynamics<ul>
<li>These bar nights are dominated by the same kind of people
    often though. The big parties are things like people
    partying after their exams. That feels like the kind of
    events you want to be at, but first I don't really know how
    to hear about them, if it is not my major (I guess this is
    intentional?)<ul>
<li>At the same time corona adds this second layer of
    ambigouity because I think the current situation is
    rather ridiculus with 97% of students at my university
    being vaccinated, but really huge parties would still
    probably be a thing to avoid? My strategy so far had
    mostly been just going more with my antisocial side, so
    I wouldn't have to think about the pandemic.<ul>
<li>It also adds this layer where it makes it hard to
    talk with other people about this stuff because you
    don't want to seem like the reckless person.<ul>
<li>Am I being reckless? Maybe I do not have the
    right perspective on this? To be honest I am
    just really tired of this whole thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wait!!! While writing this I was thinking that it should
    be trivially easy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2025-02-04: Update on this or on finding yourself and your people</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta: I feel like I want to just dump what I have been thinking on my last walk here and I don't know if I have the strength to later turn this into an actual inspiring blogpost like the one https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uGDtroD26aLvHSoK2/dear-self-we-need-to-talk-about-ambition-1 or the one from Nate Soares (although I don't know how to associate with that Uberhuman), or the ones from bhauth (He must somewhere have this post where he talks about being child progidy, reading feynman lectures and other stuff like this and feeling like there wasn't anyone that made him him), or the ones from John (what I learned by reading all his posts about how he got where he is as well as asking him more questions there), or Lucius, or Dmitry (the one on how he does research)</li>
<li>people who inspire me by doing actually important things<ul>
<li>notice which ones inspire you less even though they do things you think are great: Guy starting 80k, the podcast host 80k, the philosopher young who wrote longterminism, the one who wrote precicipe, Jesse Hoogland (rather than the Alexander guy who is indeed inspiring to me). People like Nuno Sempere and other people who are focusing more on meta things)</li>
<li>notice more inspiring (all the ones mentioned), people who seem to have found the niche of what they want to do and now they need to just execute (even though they are or arent super brilliant) the brilliant math ones (Lucius, Kaarel, Dmitry, omg, the ones that aren't writing and I am therefore underappreciating), </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>currently grooving a bit on a high, because the last few months (and partially actually the entire year) you have felt this thing in your back where you feel like something like the thing referred to in the "Please don't throw your mind away" (https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RryyWNmJNnLowbhfC/please-don-t-throw-your-mind-away) post has been happening to you. Right now you feel like you are feeling more free again and like the thing in the back in your mind that represents something you slowly realize might be your actual taste or something like this can come out and feel free again.</li>
<li>What changed? Went away from parents back to Melbourne<ul>
<li>I can go into an empty classroom here instead of just working in my appartment</li>
<li>It is warm here, I just had really strong corona until recently, so couldn't move that much especially in cold, now I am not sick anymore and the weather is great and I still have the habit of walking around campus</li>
<li>I just last week got an accountability partner again, while still not going optimally, probably this added to giving me enough structure to get things done</li>
<li>Yesterday had a call with TsviBT where he was basically calling me to get advice on the imprinting in the way that I was planning to do with all these experts, but I felt I had nothing to offer these experts for interrupting with their time and how to write these emails in general. (I do feel a bit bad about being paid by him since he also doesn't have that much money and the end was awkward for that reason)</li>
<li>For the same reason I feel awkward about the meetings with Bryce. I do not understand how there is no one else to support and I am not sure at which point I should start paying him or if I should just start paying him too little. </li>
<li>Now I feel like more able to do that, because I just read this post (it was about how his idols are actually not super popular, so him being in a meetup where they showed up made their day or at least there was way less competition for talking with him than he expected) from lsuser on the fly that you should try to give people compliments in the beginning and this is going to really help with making your email worthwhile. Now I feel like sending all of these small serendipidous emails to people (For a start to Lsuser).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not being able to get good or even mediocre instead of bad grades even in classes that I enjoyed a lot like Linear Algebra or Probability theory really got to me. (Not sure what I would have done if I noticed I was even less brilliant and didn't even feel like I was way better at things when I was doing the exercises while doing bad at exams)</li>
<li>I just read articles about Discernment and taste (things in sharp left turn that Steven Byrnes talked about). The 1-3 loop is making some sense to me (although I would want to see the more thought out version of this (my curiosity, while the rest of me is aware that this would be bad if we figured out the details of this)), </li>
<li>Part of me would like to turn into the person that is just excitedly pursuing a Startup that is going to get really rich (Billions) or even small rich (millions, with me making thousands? In that case I could also really try software engineering), but feel currently this would break my heart because of my relationship with Leo.</li>
<li>Feel like the fact that my grades are bad and downstream things like feeling and experiencing to which extend that lead to me not getting interviews even for regular software engineering, and the fact that the thing I picked to "make my career" turned out to be indeed super competitive, because suddenly Chat-GPT comes along and everyone is paying attention to AI, meant that my initial plan of going into that field and feeling I could skip all the annoying things like getting a PhD</li>
<li>I feel like I have still not found my writing groove and either I just need to experiment more with ideas from first principles or what I read so far or actively look for more advice on writing and see what grooves with me.</li>
<li>potentially I could try just writing the way Neel Nanda writes his blogposts that are more informal, where he writes everything as an indented tree list. I find writing this way rather natural for my intermittend thoughts. I feel for posts like this one it would be a pain, because there is still things to edit like the section on posts similar like this one and removing too personal anecdotes (Maybe I need to switch off the mode where I write these posts in a way where they are really only written for myself and write them more to a specific audience where I am more automatically leaving out particular private details I don't want to necessarily talk about. Probably the problem with this post is that it is a personal post, so if I want to actually provide value I have to actually think which things are worth excluding (because I want to keep them in mostly)).</li>
<li>I found Gwern's advice on writing helpful, and it feels like something I could get to, where it seems his attitude towards writing is similar to mine, he just gives himself more slack to rewrite blogposts that he has been writing before. I now feel like I want to rewrite 1 particular blogpost to get started with the habit/just on a whim editing a post, since it also seems this is the way how he is being inspired to write more things. Also interesting how he only writes about things that he finds obvious. </li>
<li>I also notice that even the little writing I have done recently has helped me to more fluently write. I am proud of some of my shortforms, while I am not so proud of some of my longer writing. I am not sure what the best balance is between editing existing posts and perhaps documenting the diff, so that I do not fuck up past people.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; Switched to just writing lsusr (seems good to do given that I am underutilizing writing people and I am motivated to do this on a whim).</p></div>
