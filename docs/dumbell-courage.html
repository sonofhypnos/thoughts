    <h1>"Running with dumbbells"</h1>
    <p>Published on: September 16, 2023</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, I've been dissatisfied with the amount of workouts I do.
When I considered how to solve the issue, my brain generated the excuse
that while I like
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4y3qcbnhSmXrk6p34/running-by-default">running</a>
outside, I really don't like doing workouts with my dumbbells in my
room even though that would be a more intense and therefore more useful
workout. Somehow I ended up <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dvzwqLbpSK2nD8Yvn/aversion-factoring">actually
thinking</a>
and asked myself why I don't just take the dumbbells with me outside.
Which was of course met by resistance because it looks weird. It's even
worse! I don't know how to "properly" do curls or whatnot, and other
people would judge me on that. I noticed that I don't actually care
that much about people in my dorm judging me. These weirdness points
have low cost. In addition, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CEGnJBHmkcwPTysb7/lonely-dissent">this muscle of
rebellion</a>
seems useful to train, as I suspect it to be one of the bottlenecks that
hinders me from writing posts like this one.</p>
<p>(Though the aversions about this particular post were that these
anecdotes just seem to need way too much context to establish (I guess
writing needs practice, who would have thought). As well as frustrations
like not having implemented footnotes, so I need to choose between
annoying my reader and cutting this section).</p>
