        <div class="post-content"><p>I have some thoughts on the experience of competitiveness.
I used to be very competitive when I was into juggling. It is literally called competitive juggling.
I wonder how I can use my competitive spirits and channel them into places.</p>
<p>Some things on competitiveness I enjoyed.
What are the best mantras to get me there?
What are the type of things 
Channeling competitiveness into ambition. (Is this a good idea or a bad idea?)
There is this part of myself that wants to be better than everyone else. I wonder how you can channel this in a prosocial way. I also wonder whether that is possible at all? Like in some way if you make it more clear what the bar is, then it will be more clear for the people that are failing to see that they are failing this bar?</p>
<p>What things here ring true?
- being the pareto best in the world
