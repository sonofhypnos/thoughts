        <div class="post-content"><p>I have been learning more about biology recently and one thing that was initially confusing to me, was that RNA, this molecule that I remembered from high schol biology as this sort of executable intermediate between DNA and proteins. This type of RNA (messenger RNA or short mRNA) is actually not the only kind of RNA there is! It doesn't even make up the majority of RNA inside the cell! I thought it might be cool to have one post that gives a short introduction to each kind of RNA and it's purpose. </p>
<ul>
<li>My initial idea here is that I will roughly order them by how frequent this type of RNA is in the cell (not sure if by weight or by number of snippets (in case that makes a difference sometimes))</li>
<li>Another funny thing that people like to do when naming these RNA strands is putting an abbreviation for the type of RNA in short letters before the actual RNA. </li>
<li>Another thing to look out for with the naming for these RNA's is that sometimes they suggest to have a relatively broad scope (like microRNA), but actually, this will be something "very" specific, like RNA in a length range from 21-23, because it turned out that some specific RNA with a very specific type of job had exactly this length</li>
<li>As it turns out the minority of DNA is actually transcribed into proteins (I think this is not necessarily a bad design! RNA can actually be pretty useful for regulation and programming in cells, because RNA can be useful in reading or regulating what type of RNA is read or not)</li>
<li>
<p>For reference, I will use a human cell here (perhaps take Hela cell and the numbers from a specific textbook or something like that?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rRNA: Turns out there are more Ribosomes in  reading mRNA than there is mRNA! (about 5 times as many) So you can imagine that for any mRNA in a cell, there are multiple Ribosomes currently reading it! Every one of those Ribosomes happens to contain 2(check if that is correct) RNA strips! This brings us to something confusing: if rna in Ribosomes is broken down at the same rate as mRNA, rRNA from the Ribosome Gene has to be transcribed more often than all of the other Protein coding genes together! One thing that means is that probably these RNA's are broken down less often than others, but the way evolution solved this problem is by copying the DNA for the rRNA just a bunch of times.</p>
</li>
<li>tRNA: In order to recognize codons, there are small snippets of RNA that lock into the correct position on the Ribosome to read it. Because RNA is read all the time, these snippets have to float around a lot.</li>
<li>piRNA: </li>
<li>siRNA</li>
<li>small nuclear RNA</li>
<li>small nucleolar RNA</li>
<li>lncRNA: long non-coding Rna</li>
<li>investigate roles of dna</li>
</ul>
