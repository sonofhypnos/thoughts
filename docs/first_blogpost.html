    <h1>Migrating from lazyblorg to python</h1>
    <p>Published on: August 30, 2024</p>
    <p>Today I switched my blog away from <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a>. While I really liked the philosophy and the fact that I could just write a blogpost anywhere in my org files, I had become frustrated with all the features I couldn't use in lazyblorg, like footnotes. I then asked claude to write me a simple blogging site with markdown which taught me that python actually already has markdown support in it's standard library. So parsing markdown for a blogpost turned out as easy as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=[&quot;meta&quot;, &quot;footnotes&quot;, &quot;fenced_code&quot;])
html = md.convert(content)
return html, md.Meta
</code></pre>
<p>where the metadata currently only contains the title and the date of the blogpost.</p>
<p>Another reason I decided to switch to markdown, is that it would make it easier to manually post my writing on lesswrong as well as here (since I can just paste the markdown into the editor on lesswrong). Sure I could connect my blog to my lesswrong account via RSS, but I think I like having only writing more "important" things as full blogposts on lesswrong and writing lots of small post on my main blog and then maybe posting them as a shortform on lesswrong. <a href="(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonofhypnos/thoughts/63ac38e2525e58042232fb7cf79c303b41c36eff/generate_blog.py)">Here</a> is the full source file as of me writing this post and <a href="/generate_blog.py">here</a> is the current one (if it still exists). I am currently using jinja for convenience for the templates, but maybe I decide later I want python as my only dependency.</p>
