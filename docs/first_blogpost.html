    <h1>Migrating From Lazyblorg to Python</h1>
    <p>Published on: September 01, 2024</p>
    <p>Today I switched my blog away from <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a>. While I really liked the philosophy and the fact that I could just write a blogpost anywhere in my org files, I had become frustrated with all the features I couldn't use in lazyblorg, like footnotes. I then asked claude to write me a simple blogging site with markdown which taught me that python actually already has markdown support in it's standard library. So parsing markdown for a blogpost turned out as easy as:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">md</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">markdown</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Markdown</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">extensions</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;meta&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;footnotes&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;fenced_code&quot;</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">html</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">md</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">convert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">html</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">md</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Meta</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>where the metadata currently only contains the title and the date of the blogpost.</p>
<p>Another reason I decided to switch to markdown, is that it would make it easier to manually post my writing on lesswrong as well as here (since I can just paste the markdown into the editor on lesswrong). Sure I could connect my blog to my lesswrong account via RSS, but I think I like having only writing more "important" things as full blogposts on lesswrong and writing lots of small post on my main blog and then maybe posting them as a shortform on lesswrong. <a href="(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonofhypnos/thoughts/63ac38e2525e58042232fb7cf79c303b41c36eff/generate_blog.py)">Here</a> is the full source file as of me writing this post and <a href="/generate_blog.py">here</a> is the current one (if it still exists). I am currently using jinja for convenience for the templates, but maybe I decide later I want python as my only dependency.</p>
