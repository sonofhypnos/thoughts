    <h1>Ourworldindata</h1>
    <p>Published on: November 21, 2023</p>
    <p>Things I learned from exploring the data on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">ourworldindata.org</a></p>
<ul>
<li>india is about 9 Germanies</li>
<li>the fact that the median age for the majority of human history is
    actually super young is something that I do not really have in my
    mind that much. Old people really had more authority back then. It
    probably also told you a lot more about a person if they were still
    alieve in the sense that they must have had good strategy to some
    extend.</li>
<li>It is interesting how the median age in mexico the median age
    actually goes down as the population first increases and then it
    goes up again as the birth-rate adjusts</li>
<li>do this as a stream?</li>
<li>
<p>oh wow the working children thing in bangladesh is actually
    horrific! 32 hours per week? (on the other hand, that is basically
    like school. The problem is that this is the mean hours not the max
    hours)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>what the fuck is up with bangladesh? Do they only do this to not
    so smart children? Why do they not get to an equilibrium where
    the children are working less? Who is justifying this in that
    place? Is the problem that the children have such bad
    alternatives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what are these families that get children and then cannot afford
    to keep them? What is going wrong there? Why is that a
    persistent equilibrium?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevertheless, poverty stricken families, usually show less
    interest in adopting family planning measures which ultimately
    turns a family large in size with lot of sufferings in
    maintaining the family. &gt; Due to little learning, poverty and
    lack of awareness, many parents consider education as a non
    gainful activity</p>
<p><code>{.example}
given the circumstance, I would indeed expect these schools to actually not be great.
hild labour is also increasing due to non availability of education materials, lack of opportunity for education and indifferent attitude of parents regarding the negative impact of child labour.</code></p>
