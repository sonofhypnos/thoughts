    <h1>Journal Prompts in Emacs</h1>
    <p>Published on: January 30, 2022</p>
    <p>While I enjoy journaling in Emacs and, asking oneself the same questions
every day becomes boring for me really quickly. My new solution is to
give myself a random prompt from a list of nice introspective questions
I stole from <a href="https://clearerthinking.org">https://clearerthinking.org</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> . This is pretty easily
implemented in Elisp <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">;list with your prompts
(setq custom/journal-prompts '(&quot;What is on your mind?&quot;
                               &quot;What did you achieve today?&quot;
                               &quot;What worried you today?&quot;))
(defun custom/random-phrase ()
  &quot;command to insert prompt at cursor&quot;
    (interactive)
    (insert (seq-random-elt custom/journal-prompts)))
</code></pre>
<p>Happy random journaling!</p>

<p>In the beginning I had high aspirations by weighting how often I
get to see a prompt by how useful it was, but this (at least so far)
turned out to be an overengineered solution, because it's very easy
to just generate a new prompt, so I did not bother with that in the
end.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
