    <h1>"Journal prompts in Emacs"</h1>
    <p>Published on: January 30, 2022</p>
    <p>While I enjoy journaling in Emacs and, asking oneself the same questions
every day becomes boring for me really quickly. My new solution is to
give myself a random prompt from a list of nice introspective questions
I stole from <a href="https://clearerthinking.org">https://clearerthinking.org</a>[^1] . This is pretty easily
implemented in Elisp [^2]:</p>
<p><code>{.elisp}
;list with your prompts
(setq custom/journal-prompts '("What is on your mind?"
                               "What did you achieve today?"
                               "What worried you today?"))
(defun custom/random-phrase ()
  "command to insert prompt at cursor"
    (interactive)
    (insert (seq-random-elt custom/journal-prompts)))</code></p>
<p>Happy random journaling!</p>

<p>[^1]: If you are really curious, you can just take a look at <a href="https://github.com/sonofhypnos/emacs-config">my
    config</a>.</p>
<p>[^2]: In the beginning I had high aspirations by weighting how often I
    get to see a prompt by how useful it was, but this (at least so far)
    turned out to be an overengineered solution, because it's very easy
    to just generate a new prompt, so I did not bother with that in the
    end.</p>
