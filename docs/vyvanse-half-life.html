    <h1>"Vyvanse Half-life"</h1>
    <p>Published on: August 21, 2024</p>
    <p>Since I am 12 I have been taking Vyvanse. In the instructions it says
the drugs should last on average for 13 hours and their onset is within
1h. But what does that really <strong>mean</strong> in terms of how much of the
medication is actually in my blood over time?</p>
<ul>
<li>How processes like these work in the body/exponential decay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Math: so the most important thing to be aware of is that typically drugs
will display an exponential decay, because the rate at which the drug is
removed and/or metabolized in the body is proportional to the amount of
drug in the body. Usually because the choice of point is essentially
arbitrary is my understanding, people decided for processes like these,
we will call a process like this to be \"on\" when we have reached 1/2
of the peak concentration and we will say it has stopped working when
the drug has diminished to 1/2 of the peak concentration again.</p>
<p>Because this is an exponential decay, calculating how much will be in
your body after t amount of time is as easy as multiplying (1/2)\^ (t /
t~halflife~). In other words, the concentration will keep decreasing by
from it's current amount 1/2 every 12h.</p>
<p>One thing that my adhd-psychologist recommended (not sure if that
recommendation was endorsed by my psychiatrist) was to avoid citric
fruits, because they'd somehow interfere with the medication in a way
that would make it less effective (rather than cause any harmfull side
effects). Apparently this advice applied to methylphenidate as well as
to dextroamphetamine (I found that weird, why would it apply to such
different compounds), but then my mother told me that it indeed
interferes with lots of medications, which I guessed makes some sense.
(=> After looking into the citrus fruit thing, it indeed seems like it
interferes with medications, but actually it can either make them more
or less effective thus the conclusion that my family took to consume
large amounts of orange juice if someone had overdosed their medication
accidentally due to forgetfulness was actually super dangerous!)</p>
<p>Thankfully, the active ingredient in vyvanse has been heavily studied,
so it was relatively easy to get actual data for this process online.</p>

<li>
<p>Learn more about why things are half-life in the body? -> Rate of
    removal is proportional to how much material is in the blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've now gone 10 years in my life taking this medication and just
    taking the 13h that it is supposed to work for granted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>TODO open questions</h2>
<h3>TODO is there actually some other reason why you would not want to consume citrus fruit or is it only about urine pH and what is the effect of citric fruits on pH?</h3>
<p>The mean content of citric acid in g/L is maximum for lemon juice (14.86
g/L) followed by orange juice (7.83 g/L) and least for lime juice (1.71
g/L). 0.5g vitamin C (orange and lemon)</p>
<h3>TODO if you were to have a sudden decrease in the concentration (especially from the peak), could that cause addiction?</h3>
<ul>
<li>My current model is that somehow high dosages and whatever druggies
    usually do cause addiction (sudden onset perhaps more than sudden
    drop?) and that professionals try to actively fight this for
    morphium</li>
</ul>
<h3>TODO what exactly is up</h3>
