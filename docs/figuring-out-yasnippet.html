    <h1>Figuring Out Yasnippet</h1>
    <p>Published on: March 19, 2022</p>
    <p>Today I finally took the time to figure to the YASnippet Emacs package
to create a template for my new blogposts. Turns out there was not a lot
to understand. To create a new template you run `M-x`
`yas-new-snippet`. In the then opening buffer you just enter your
template in plain text and hit `C-c C-c` when you're done.</p>
<p>The three other elements that I needed for my simple snippets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>`\$0` denotes where the cursor should end up after the snippet is
    inserted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emacs lisp code to be evaluated with the snipped can be inserted
    within backquotes. Example: the following snippet enters the current
    date in iso-format:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-commonlisp">`(format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)` $0
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Elements to be completed at point are entered with {N: default
    value} as an example here is the template for a for-loop in C:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (${1:i = 0}; ${2:i &lt; N}; ${3:i++}) {
    $0
        }
</code></pre>
