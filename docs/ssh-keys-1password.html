    <h1>Backing up ssh-keys</h1>
    <p>Published on: May 21, 2024</p>
    <p>After watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aolI_Rz0ZqY">excellent video on more advanced and new things in
git</a>, I decided to setup
signing my git commands through ssh.</p>
<p>That is easily done through:</p>
<p><code>{.bash org-language="sh"}
ssk-keygen -f ~/.ssh/git
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/git</code></p>
<p>Next I got a bit concerned though, because so far I had always just
taken for granted that I might loose my ssh-keys if I start using a
different device. I have backups and all, but it seemed prudent to put
these into my password Manager also (I use 1password, because I started
with that, but today I'd probably choose bitwarden instead as it's
open source).</p>
<p>You can add your ssh-key programmatically to 1password like so:</p>
<p><code>{.bash org-language="sh"}
op item create --category=ssh-key --title="$key_name" \
    --vault='Private' --session="$OP_SESSION" \
    "Keys.private[password]=$private_key_content" \
    "Keys.public[concealed]=$public_key_content"</code></p>
