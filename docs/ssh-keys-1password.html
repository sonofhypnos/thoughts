    <h1>Backing up Ssh-keys</h1>
    <p>Published on: May 21, 2024</p>
    <p>After watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aolI_Rz0ZqY">excellent video on more advanced and new things in
git</a>, I decided to setup
signing my git commands through ssh.</p>
<p>That is easily done through:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssk-keygen -f ~/.ssh/git
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/git
</code></pre>
<p>Next I got a bit concerned though, because so far I had always just
taken for granted that I might loose my ssh-keys if I start using a
different device. I have backups and all, but it seemed prudent to put
these into my password Manager also (I use 1password, because I started
with that, but today I'd probably choose bitwarden instead as it's
open source).</p>
<p>You can add your ssh-key programmatically to 1password like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">op item create --category=ssh-key --title=&quot;$key_name&quot; \
    --vault='Private' --session=&quot;$OP_SESSION&quot; \
    &quot;Keys.private[password]=$private_key_content&quot; \
    &quot;Keys.public[concealed]=$public_key_content&quot;
</code></pre>
