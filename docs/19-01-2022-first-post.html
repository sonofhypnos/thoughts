                <p>Today I finally managed to get a blogging setup with orgmode working.
This has honestly been one of my more stressful projects so far.
According to my timetracking data, I have spent at least 26 hours
tinkering with different solutions, sweating over whether I should go
anonymous or not, whether to continue to use my <a href="https://github.com/sonofhypnos/blog">jekyll
setup</a> and other overwhelming
details.</p>
<p>In the end I decided to go with
<a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a>. While
<a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">lazyblorg</a> promises to make
blogging low effort, therefore making blogging a sustainable habit for
me, it is definitely not the easiest solution to set up in the first
place. I had already once tried to use it, but must have gotten stuck at
some point that I don't even remember anymore. It still took me 4 hours
yesterday to go from "Ok lets finally do this", to now where I managed
to create this blogpost and be able to see it in the browser. I am
honestly not quite sure what took me so long, but one thing that
definitely was tricky, was getting all of the meta-data right, that is
required for a blogpost. Things I have allowed to put off for now is
tweaking the CSS file, fixing the broken Header of the webpage or
removing the example blogposts.</p>
