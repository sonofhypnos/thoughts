                <p>Today I want to show you the amazing device that ran my life for...3
years? It's this smart watch:</p>
<p><img alt="photo" src="/images/old-smartwatch.png" /></p>
<p>The specific model is the ZGPAX S8. My father got it gifted at a
conference and gave it to me after finding no use for it. First I
uninstalled all the useless apps on it and installed the Nova Launcher.</p>
<h2>What I used the watch for:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Timetracking<ul>
<li>On the main screen you can see the main categories that I
    tracked with this watch. Starting to track a category only
    needed three clicks. 1 to get to the home screen and two to
    select the category to track.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Timers<ul>
<li>The multitimer app on the homescreen is very useful for
    pomodoros</li>
<li>The left app on the homescreen is also a timer app that I used
    for arbitrary time-intervals when I did not want to forget
    something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Search for a replacement</h2>
<p>To this day I haven't found a more convenient way to run my timers and
timetracking. By now I am just using the same apps on my phone. It's
less convenient, but unfortunately Google stopped supporting the android
version of this watch. I tried getting a new one, but it's hard to get
full-android watches. I just recently bought a watch for 250€ (<a href="https://store.rogbid.com/products/brave3">the
Brave3</a>), because I thought it
would be able to support this workflow, but for some reason I was then
not able to run the playstore on it (it just crashed). I also tried
using the <a href="https://www.amazon.de/KOSPET-Smartwatch-HD-Touchscreen-Gesicht-ID-Herzfrequenzmessung-Schwarz/dp/B08S72N562?th=1">Kospet
note</a>.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/ypl7yh/do_square_full_android_watches_that_are_small/">It successfully ran my
apps</a>,
it was just so large it hurt my wrist.</p>
