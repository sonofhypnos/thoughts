        <div class="post-content"><p>Today I tried remapping the Fn-key on my keyboard after my Ctrl-key
stopped working reliably (I suspect it's a hardware issue). While I
first suspected this to not be possible at all, because a lot of
keyboards do not even send the Keypress Events from the Fn-keys to the
kernel, for my laptop keyboard this seems to have not been the case, as
I was able to see the keypresses with "xev". Next, I tried rebinding
the key with xmodmap using its keycode (151): xmodmap -e 'keycode 151 =
Control~L~', but that did not work for mysterious reasons.</p>
<p>After some more failed attempts, I tried using setkeycodes, which
directly changes the map of the keyboard-driver to change which keycode
would be returned upon pressing the scan-codes sent by the keyboard.
Remapping the Fn key there did work, but for to me mysterious reasons,
the keycodes for setkeycodes are offset by 8, so I ran "sudo
setkeycodes e063 29" which successfully bound the key to keycode 37
according to xev when I ran it afterward. Apparently the keycodes sent
by kernel are different than the ones by xev.</p>
<p>Afterwards I realized I could have looked for the corresponding
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_input">archwiki entry about keyboard
input</a> long ago to get
an overview of how this roughly works on linux. It mentions
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_input#Identifying_keycodes_in_Xorg">complications like the
offset</a>
between kernel and Xorg keycodes.</p></div>
