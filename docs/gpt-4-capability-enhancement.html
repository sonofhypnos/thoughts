    <h1>Using Gpt-4 for Personal Capability Enhancement</h1>
    <p>Published on: October 17, 2023</p>
    <p>Inspired by Gwern's article on Google search. I set up a Scratch window
in i3, so now I have gpt4 just 2 simultaneous keypresses away.</p>
<p>I feel like it is really nice to use GPT-4 to ask it about interpersonal
stuff. "GPT-4 I want to tell my supervisor X or I am considering
writing Y how do you think this will come across". You think it's a
good idea? It's also really nice for writing one-off plotting code in
python and things along those lines. Things I haven't tried yet so far,
but would be interested to hear from others, is using gpt-4 as sort of
my personal coach/trainer. Like if I tell gpt-4 in it's base prompt
what kinds of things I might get distracted by it can get me back on
track when it notices I am distracted (Yeah this sounds insane.) I also
wonder how well gpt-4 might get at giving me challenging+engaging
problems. Like I could ask gpt-4 to give me some for me solvable problem
out of a subject area that I only understand on a shallow level (say
evolutionary biology) and then gpt-4 could prompt me on some proplem
that leads deriving some important quantity in that field. One thing I
find really annoying is that I don't have full-text search history for
my chats with gpt-4. It feels I also feel like I am not really
integrated into</p>
<p>Since then I have wondered what other people</p>
<ul>
<li>Having GPT-4 very accessible has been an interesting experience.<ul>
<li>very useful for throwaway plotting code.</li>
<li>If there's an established method and gpt-4 knows about it,
    great! complicated formulas? Easy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do feel like I have been a bit too tempted to outsource some very
    easy for loops to gpt-4 and I actually don't like that part that's
    like making me weaker?<ul>
<li>or at least if it is not coding better than me</li>
<li>I actually wonder in how far gpt-4 can already be used for
    coaching and pushing myself (keeping me in the ). Like having
    the combination of text-books, wikipedia and chat-gpt to learn
    some stuff about particle physics felt interesting. Although not
    a lot came from that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gpt-4 for anki (how to make convenient)</li>
<li>inconvenient is that I don't have clear file search for my emacs
    stuff</li>
<li>Actually it seems like semantic search for all of my files on my
    computer could be viable now!</li>
</ul>
<p>How can I use GPT-4 and related models to actually be more productive?
How can I use it to push myself?</p>
<ul>
<li>I can ask gpt-4 to ask me math questions and perhaps if I always
    give it 5 minutes and then it gets feedback from me it might
    actually get good at</li>
<li>giving me questions that are productive for me.<ul>
<li>How well do I expect gpt-4 to be effective there if well
    prompted compared to a good tutor I might have access to?<ul>
<li>This seems actually like a very important question. If
    there's a way to get an A tutor out of gpt that would be
    really useful</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask other people how they use gpt-4 for munchkinism like this.</li>
<li>I can use gpt-4 as a constant translator on topics that I do not yet
    know stuff about.</li>
<li>One thing were I feel there is a lot of untapped potential is having
    gpt-4 directly at my cursor sometimes?</li>
<li>I also get frustrated, because at least when just using the chat
    interface, there's just a single prompt I use.<ul>
<li>Like usually I tell gpt-4 to be really informal with me, but
    that is counterproductive if I want it to correct my spelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also feel like I want to get better at the sort of "quickly
    testing hypotheses thing" that neel is sometimes talking about
    (TODO: this is an instance where it would be nice to have the
    semantic search to find that comment)</li>
</ul>
