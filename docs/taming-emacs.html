                <p>Right after <a href="id:19-01-2022-first-post">creating my blog with Lazyblorg</a>,
I had a hard time using Emacs to write my Blogposts instead of just
using the markdown editor on <a href="https://lesswrong.com">lesswrong</a>. Truth
is Emacs isn't the perfect writing environment for me yet, but it is
slowly getting to that point. What was bugging me the most, was the
lacking linting and spellchecking through LanguageTool that I've grown
accustomed to in the browser. By now I figured out that I had disabled
the default flycheck features, which are actually rather neat and very
good at identifying my mistakes. I've now actually taken the time to
configure LanguageTool. I suddenly realized that this also solved my
other problem, which was getting rid of meta-comments in the final
versions of my blogposts. For now, I can just add the TODO keyword and
flycheck will remind me, that this should probably be removed at some
point. Next I've installed LanguageTool on my system, so I could get
the superb corrections not only in the browser, but in Emacs as well.
