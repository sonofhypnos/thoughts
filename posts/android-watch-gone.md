Today I want to show you the amazing device that ran my life for...3
years? It\'s this smart watch:

The specific model is the ZGPAX S8. My father got it gifted at a
conference and gave it to me after finding no use for it. First I
uninstalled all the useless apps on it and installed the Nova Launcher.

What I used the watch for:
--------------------------

-   Timetracking
    -   On the main screen you can see the main categories that I
        tracked with this watch. Starting to track a category only
        needed three clicks. 1 to get to the home screen and two to
        select the category to track.
-   Timers
    -   The multitimer app on the homescreen is very useful for
        pomodoros
    -   The left app on the homescreen is also a timer app that I used
        for arbitrary time-intervals when I did not want to forget
        something.

Search for a replacement
------------------------

To this day I haven\'t found a more convenient way to run my timers and
timetracking. By now I am just using the same apps on my phone. It\'s
less convenient, but unfortunately Google stopped supporting the android
version of this watch. I tried getting a new one, but it\'s hard to get
full-android watches. I just recently bought a watch for 250€ ([the
Brave3](https://store.rogbid.com/products/brave3)), because I thought it
would be able to support this workflow, but for some reason I was then
not able to run the playstore on it (it just crashed). I also tried
using the [Kospet
note](https://www.amazon.de/KOSPET-Smartwatch-HD-Touchscreen-Gesicht-ID-Herzfrequenzmessung-Schwarz/dp/B08S72N562?th=1).
[It successfully ran my
apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/ypl7yh/do_square_full_android_watches_that_are_small/),
it was just so large it hurt my wrist.
