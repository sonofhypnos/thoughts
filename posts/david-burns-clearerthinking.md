Summary
-------

-   The podcast is about ideas that matter and in this episode, Spencer
    speaks with David Burns about cognitive behavioral therapy and the
    team technique.
-   EA New York City is hosting a live recording of the podcast on
    January 30th, 2024.
-   David Burns is a pioneer in cognitive behavioral therapy and
    popularized it through his book Feeling Good.
-   Cognitive therapy focuses on identifying and challenging negative
    thoughts that contribute to emotional distress.
-   Cognitive therapy helps individuals recognize thinking errors and
    replace them with more accurate and positive thoughts.
-   Cognitive therapy has evolved over time, but the early techniques
    are still used today.
-   Thoughts create our emotions, and challenging negative thoughts can
    lead to a change in feelings.
-   An example is given of a patient who attempted suicide and had
    negative thoughts about her worth, which were challenged through
    therapy.
-   A patient was feeling worthless and had not accomplished anything in
    life except working as a cleaning lady
-   The therapist suggested she make a list of her accomplishments for
    the next session
-   The patient listed several significant achievements, including
    escaping the concentration camps with her children, providing for
    her family, and her son\'s success
-   The therapist helped the patient realize that her negative beliefs
    about herself were not true and were based on thinking errors
-   The patient felt a lot better after recognizing her accomplishments
    and challenging her negative thoughts

-   They have found that it is possible to eliminate negative feelings
    in a single therapy session, but relapse prevention training is
    necessary.

    information by sending them daily flashcard quizzes.
-   The tool offers ready-made decks of flashcards on various topics or
    allows users to create their own.
-   The therapy model discussed in the conversation is called TEAM,
    which stands for Testing, Empathy, Agenda Setting/Assessment of
    Resistance, and Methods.

    conducts rapid replications of psychology studies to improve
    reliability and promote clarity.
-   The role of SSRIs in treating depression is questioned, with some
    research suggesting they have no effects beyond the placebo effect.
-   Physical exercise can have a placebo effect on mental health, but
    research has shown that endorphins may not play a significant role
    in improving mood.
-   Personal experiences and thoughts on exercise and mental health
    vary, with some individuals finding exercise helpful and others not.

    speaker aims to develop more powerful treatments.
-   Cognitive therapy, as taught in the book \"Feeling Good,\" has shown
    positive outcomes in studies.
-   Resistance is a factor that needs to be addressed in therapy to
    improve outcomes.
-   Other forms of therapy may have a slight advantage over placebo, but
    not significantly.
-   Relapses in negative thoughts are common, but learning to
    effectively challenge and crush those thoughts can help in bouncing
    back.

Hello and welcome to Clearer Thinking with Spencer Greenberg, the
podcast about ideas that matter. I\'m Josh Castle, the producer of the
podcast, and I\'m so glad you joined us today. In this episode, Spencer
speaks with David Burns about cognitive behavioral therapy and the team
technique. Before we get into the episode, we wanted to let you know
that EA New York City is hosting Spencer for a live recording of the
Clearer Thinking podcast on January 30th, 2024. The event is titled The
Moral Status of Insects and AI Systems and other thorny questions in
global priorities research with Jeff, Sebo, and Spencer Greenberg. If

events. David, welcome. Thank you. I\'m excited to be on your show and
honored. Well, I\'m so excited to have you on. You probably don\'t
realize this, but you were such a huge influence on me because I read
your classic book Feeling Good about cognitive behavioral therapy when I
was a young man. And it just had a profound impact on my life. It really
got me to think differently about my own thoughts and my own emotions. I
found it incredibly useful. I ended up going to a CBT therapist after
reading the book because I was so, I was like, wow, this is amazing. And
it also started my journey really thinking about psychology and getting
really excited about it. So, yeah, it\'s just very exciting to be
talking to you for the first time. Well, that\'s great. It was my
pleasure. I\'m just thrilled. And for the audience members that have not
heard your name, you were really one of the people that popularized
cognitive behavioral therapy, also known as CBT. I mean, before that, it
was kind of a fringe thing. So, why don\'t we start there? What was,
what was therapy like back in the day when you published Feeling Good?
Well, yeah, I had been doing cognitive therapy for a few years. I had
left my full-time position at the university after my residency. I was
supposed to stay on at the medical school and I got a grant from the
federal government to develop a kind of a brain chemistry research
laboratory because everyone was saying that, you know, depressions due
to some chemical imbalance in the brain. And our research gave powerful
evidence that that was absolutely not true. And clinically, I saw that,
you know, what I was doing wasn\'t helping people. Well, I was giving
out antidepressants by the bushel fall. I would just say to people, tell
me more. And we were just supposed to encourage people to talk and give
them pills. And I almost never saw anyone really recover from
depression. And then I heard about Aaron Beck\'s cognitive therapy. And
the department chairman says, why don\'t you check this out? He says
that depression is due to negative thinking. And I said, that sounds
really stupid. He sounds like Norman Vincent Peel\'s power of positive
thinking. And he said, well, why don\'t you just go to his weekly
seminar and then you can try it with your patients and prove to yourself
that it doesn\'t work. And I said, yeah, that would be kind of cool. So
I started going to his weekly seminar and there were only about seven of
us or five of us that maybe want a big week. We\'d have 12 people there.
And I would take my most difficult patients and present them. And I say,
here\'s this, I have this woman just referred to me from the intensive
care unit. And she\'s an elderly woman who attempted suicide. And she
survived that they\'ve sent her to me for follow-up care. What should I
do? And then I\'d get input from back and we\'ll try this and I\'d go
and I\'d try it. And usually it was very effective. And I became amazed
and I said, wow, this is for real. So I said, I don\'t want to do that
brain chemistry research and hand out Peel\'s, Peel\'s, Peel\'s. I want
to do something that will help people change their lives and go from
despair to joy. And so that\'s what it was like in the early days was
kind of helping people identify these distortions and their thoughts and
make them aware that your thoughts create all of your emotions and you
can change the way you feel. And it was just a very exciting, giddy time
and then after feeling good came out, it began to spread. And as you
know, it\'s now the most widespread cognitive therapy form of therapy in
the world. And so we were successful in popularizing cognitive therapy.
Now I\'m trying to get people to think in new dimensions because we\'ve
kind of gone further ahead that therapy is morphed quite dramatically.
But I still use the early cognitive therapy techniques I learned from
back and developed and continue to develop this very day. And for those
who don\'t know, Aaron Beck is considered one of the fathers of
cognitive therapy. So David was working directly with the originators of
the method, which is so cool. But you know, one thing you mentioned this
idea of the power and positive thinking. And I think people can confuse
that with CBT. So maybe you could break down. How does what cognitive
therapy tells you to do differ from just say thinking possibly? Well,
thinking, telling people to think positively is never helpful. It\'s not
a technique I\'ve used. I\'ve learned or developed, you know, over a
hundred techniques to help people crush the distorted thoughts that
cause the misery that we all have. But what you have to do is is get
someone to the point where they suddenly see that what they were telling
themselves is actually not true. And in that very moment, the person\'s
feelings will suddenly change. And you know, the first idea of it is you
think the way you feel and that goes back to epictetus 2,000 years ago
said he\'s a stoic philosopher, a Greek guy. And he said people are not
disturbed by things or events, but by our views we have of them. In
other words, your thoughts create all of your feelings. And that\'s been
controversial for 2,000 years. And we\'ve just recently got some data
that helped us test that scientifically with data from an app I\'ve been
developing. But to make it simple for the listeners, you can probably
recognize these negative thinking patterns in yourself. Maybe I\'ve had
that thought, you know, I\'m not good enough. I\'m not smart enough.
What\'s wrong with me? Or maybe you\'re shy and anxious around other
people? I had that problem for an awful long time. And a lot of times
people were shy and anxious. They\'re also ashamed saying, what\'s wrong
with me? I shouldn\'t be so anxious. Other people don\'t have this
problem. Or you have public speaking anxiety. And you\'re saying, I\'m
just going to blow it when I get in front of the audience. So my mind
will go blank. Or when you\'re feeling down, you tell yourself, I\'m a
hopeless case. I\'m inferior human being. There\'s nothing special about
me. And the first thing is to help people identify the thinking errors
or cognitive distortions in those thoughts and then help them smash the
thought. But you know, prove to yourself that they\'re that they\'re not
valid. That was the original cognitive therapy. We\'re like like that.
And maybe I can think of an example. I have my weekly teaching group at
Stanford. And it\'s free to clinicians from all over the world. If any
of them want to join our group, you can. We meet for two hours every
Tuesday night and teach clinicians these new techniques. But one of the
first patients I presented to back was this woman. And it was sad.
She\'d attempted suicide. And she survived the suicide attempt. And so I
said to Dr. Beck, well, what, what, how can I help a suicidal patient?
She\'s pretty serious. And I told her I presented her case in the, in
the weekly training group that you\'ve got here. And, you know, and I\'d
tell her what you said. And, and Dr. Beck said, well, ask her how she
was thinking the moment she tried to kill herself because thoughts
create all of our emotions, all our positive and negative emotions. So
what was she telling herself? So I said, ah, that makes perfect sense.
So I so eager to see her the next week. And she said, what did you learn
in the seminar? And I said, oh, Dr. Beck said that I was supposed to ask
you what you were telling yourself when you tried to kill yourself
because your thoughts create all of your feelings. And she said, oh, I
was telling myself that that I\'m a worthless human being because I\'ve
never accomplished anything in my life. And all I\'ve done is clean
people\'s houses and scrub their, their floors. And, you know, and
there\'s just nothing, nothing special about me. And, you know, I just
feel like a kind of a failure as a human being and worthless. I feel
worthless. And that\'s that\'s why I tried to kill myself. So what
should I do about it? And I said, oh gosh, I don\'t know. You\'ll have
to wait another week. I\'ll go back to this house. I\'ll ask Dr. Beck.
And I\'ll tell you what it tells me. So I went went back and, and Dr.
Beck said, well, tell her to make a list of things she has accomplished
in her life. And I said, ah, that makes perfect sense. So I went back to
her and she said, what, what did Dr. Beck say? And I said, well, he said
to ask you about some of the things you have accomplished in your life.
And she said, well, see, that\'s my problem. I haven\'t accomplished
anything except, you know, scrubbing people\'s floors and cleaning their
houses. That\'s all I\'ve done. A cleaning lady. And she said, so what
should I do? And I, you know, I knew so little about this new cognitive
therapy at the time. And so I said, well, maybe you can take it as a
homework as sign, but because that was another thing we were assigning
homework to our patients to do between sessions. I said, maybe, maybe
you can think of something you\'ve accomplished and then put it on a
list and you can bring it to our next session. So she agreed to do that.
The next session I went back and I forgot to ask her about her list. And
I, you know, asked her about her antidepressant because I was still
prescribing antidepressants and kind of foolishly hoping they\'d do a
lot for people, which they rarely did. And getting them to talk. And so
we were halfway through the session. And I was listening and she was
talking. And then she said, well, didn\'t you want to ask me about my
homework? And I said, oh, I forgot all about it. Did you, were you able
to list anything? And she handed me a piece of paper with about 10
things on it that she listed. And the first one, she said, I, I forgot
that I almost all of our family died in the in the concentration camps
in Germany. But I managed to escape with my children and I got them to
the United States and saved their lives. My husband died in the
concentration camps and everyone else died. And she said, so I thought
maybe that was an accomplishment of sorts. And then I thought, well, and
once we got to the United States, I started working cleaning people\'s
houses and scrubbing floors. And I was able to get a roof over our heads
and food for my, my boys and, you know, placed to sleep at night. And so
I thought, well, maybe I could get myself credit for that. And then she
said, my son just graduated first in his class at Harvard Business
School. And so that seems like a good thing too. And then she wrote down
and I forgot that I speak five foreign languages fluently. And then she
wrote down and I\'m a gourmet chef. And there was this tears going down.
My cheeks, I said, well, how did you, how do you reconcile that with the
idea that you were worthless human being? And she says, doctor, it
doesn\'t make any sense what I was telling myself. It just, it doesn\'t
compute at all. And I said, well, how are you feeling now? She says,
I\'m suddenly feeling a lot, a lot better. Do you have any more of these
techniques? I said, well, you have to wait another week. I\'ll ask Dr.
Beck and I\'ll learn another one. I\'ve been learning one technique each
week. And that\'s the first one I\'ve learned. But it was, so that, that
was the story of how, how it all all started. And suddenly I saw people
going from tears, tears to joy. And I wanted to spend my life like that,
not handing people pills and seeing few or no changes. But it was, it
was, it was very, very exciting. But over the years, it had, like
everything, there were strengths in the early cognitive therapy. There
were weaknesses. And it\'s evolved. And you know, I\'ve done a lot of
research. I\'ve had over 40,000 hours with treating people with severe
depression and anxiety for all over the world. And, and it\'s been a
tremendous adventure to evolve psychotherapy. Where now it\'s, it\'s
even vastly more powerful and effective than the techniques we had in
the early days of cognitive therapy. I might say that just to illustrate
her point though, that you see, she was involved in thinking errors. And
one would be called mental filtering. Like she\'s focusing on the
negatives in her life. And then discounting the positives, so
overlooking what was beautiful about her and her, and, and, and her
life. She was also involved in a distortion called emotional reasoning,
reasoning from her feelings. She she felt worthless. So she thought, I
must be worthless because I feel worthless. And she was also thinking, I
feel hopeless. So I must be hopeless. And then she thought of suicide as
the only escape from her pain. But there\'s 10 or 12 of those of those
thinking errors. And I just found it philosophically mind blowing that
depression results is a lie. And anxiety, you know, is based on lies
too, that you\'re telling yourself things that are not true. But you
don\'t realize you\'re fooling yourself because the those, you know,
thinking errors are very subtle. And so people are as sure as a fact
that they\'re skin on their hands, that they\'re worthless and hopeless,
human beings. And when they discover that that\'s all a hoax, it\'s not
true. It\'s one of the greatest feelings in the world being flooded from
tears and worthlessness to joy. It\'s it\'s it\'s incredible. And it\'s
incredible for the therapist to to give people that experience. One
thing that really impressed me about CBT when I first learned about it
was that I could search and notice it in my own mind, right? So yes,
there were the studies and those were very impressive. But there
additionally, I could start paying attention to what\'s going on in my
mind. And I could search and notice, hey, you know, when I\'m feeling
emotional, I\'ll believe something. And then later when I\'m feeling
better, I\'m like, that have of course, I was not true, right? Yeah,
it\'s amazing, isn\'t it? It really is. And if you start being mindful
about your own thoughts, you start seeing these tricks your mind plays
on you. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it\'s it\'s really incredible. It\'s
enlightening. A lot of people don\'t believe it. They don\'t they don\'t
grasp it. They they they fight against this idea. But I saw it in
myself. My wife is a clinical psychologist. She\'s the brains in our
family. And she saw it in herself too. And we use these ideas in our own
lives and the lives of our our children. And you know, I never would
have committed my life in this direction if it hadn\'t been for that. I
remember once I presented a patient to Dr. Beck in one of the seminars,
his patient was coming to the clinic at the University of Pennsylvania
Hospital. And I think he wasn\'t he was behind in his bill or something
like that. And I said something about it. And you know, he the patient
got upset. And so I told Dr. Beck and he said that, you know, you
didn\'t handle that properly at all. And what you said probably hurt
your patient\'s feelings. And you gave me some other idea how I should
have handled it. And I panicked. And here\'s this great man telling me
that I\'m just, you know, out of my residency and I\'m screwing up with
the patient. And I began to I went home on the train going to to
Brynmore from the Philadelphia, the 30th Street train station there. And
I was just started feeling worthless. And I was telling myself I\'m a
terrible human being. I\'m a horrible therapist. They\'ll probably take
away my medical license. I won\'t be able to practice in Pennsylvania.
You know, I have no future in psychiatry. And those thoughts seemed
absolutely true. And then I told myself, well, you know, there must be
some distortions in those thoughts. And I said, Oh, no, this is the
truth. I\'ve seen the truth about myself for the first time. And it was
just horrible. And I got home. And these were the days where they were
talking about exercise helps and boost your brain endorphins. That all
turned out to be a lot of bullshit, by the way. But we were kind of
thinking it was true. So I went on this severe six mile run with real
steep hills. I thought that\'ll get my brain endorphins up and I\'ll
feel better. But the farther I ran, the faster I ran, the more negative
my thinking became. And it was like an absolute truth that I was a
worthless human being. It was like it was seen at the first time. And I
was thinking, how could I have spent my whole life not realizing how
horrible I am? And of course, I was involved in all or nothing thinking.
That\'s another common thinking error. You know, like one mistake and
the whole is ruined. But I didn\'t see it as a thinking error. But it\'s
how I was thinking. And hidden should statements. I should never screw
up. I should be perfect. I should always do the right thing for
patients. And then emotional reasoning again, I feel worthless. So I
must be worthless. And self blame beating up on myself instead of
treating myself with compassion or understanding. And you know,
magnification and minimization is another one magnifying how awful this
error I made with the patient. And so when I got home from the run, I
was even worse depression than when I started. And then I told myself,
well, David, why don\'t you tell your patients, write your thoughts on a
piece of damn paper and look at them and see if there\'s any thinking
errors. And then I thought, oh, no, no, this is true. I\'m really am a
horrible human being. It\'s just a fact. And then I said, no, David,
write it down on a piece of paper and see if there\'s any thinking
errors. So I say, okay, I\'ll write it down, but this is bullshit. And
so I wrote down my, you know, three or four thoughts. I\'m a worthless
human being. I screwed up. They\'re going to take away my medical
license. I have no future. And then I said, now are there any thinking
errors here? I have no future. Well, got just kind of fortune tell. And
isn\'t it? Yeah, how do I know I have no future? And then I\'m a
horrible human being. Well, that\'s kind of all or nothing thinking
there. How horrible can you be? I mean, you\'re asking the guy to pay
his bill and you didn\'t do it properly, but it\'s not like you killed
him or something. And then I started asking my, I found all these
thinking errors in my thoughts. And then I said, is there any other way
to think about it? And I said, well, maybe I could just tell myself I\'m
a beginner. I\'m a young man. And I have the right to make mistakes. And
to create, create the correct those mistakes and learn from my mistakes.
And and to, I can be kind to, to myself. And, and I\'m going to see the
patient again tomorrow. And I can tell him, hey, Mac, I feel having
terrible week because I screwed up with you last week. And I really hurt
your feelings. And I said the wrong thing. And my supervisor scolded me.
And I, I\'m just so glad that you came back for another session. And I
can imagine how hurt and angry you feel and disappointed. Let, let\'s
talk about it. And he just started crying and he opened up. And we had
the best session ever. And then at the end of the session, he gave me
perfect score on the empathy scale and the helpfulness. Scaly said it
was a tremendous session. But it was just the same thing that you said,
Spencer, that when you experience these things yourself, you, you
suddenly see something that that you never saw before. And, and it\'s,
it\'s an amazing experience. Now, that\'s a great example. I\'ve found
that one common thing that bothers people about CBT sometimes is they,
they think that they\'re being invalidated, right? Like, they have some
really bad thing happen to them, right? Like a legitimately really bad
thing. They, let\'s say they discover their spouse is cheating on them.
They\'re like, feel horrible, right? And then they say, well, what are
you talking about? It\'s not just my thoughts. Like this really bad
thing happened to me. You don\'t invalidate my emotion by telling me
it\'s just my thinking, right? Yeah. And that\'s one of the why I
started evolving and changing cognitive therapy and morphing it into
what, what we know called team CBT. But that\'s just one of many, many
errors that therapists make cognitive therapists and probably other
therapists as well. But it\'s irritating. When you see people make such
stupid interpretations of, you know, of a new development and using it
in a corrosive way. But the first thing, you know, that you have to do
when somebody\'s upset is to empathize and say that\'s a horrible thing
that happened to you. And I feel sad too. And I can imagine how angry
and hurt you must be feeling and let tell me more about that. And
getting on the same page with with with your patient in a kind and
compassionate way and kindness and compassion will never cure anyone of
anything. But if you don\'t have it, you know, you\'re going to lose
that patient and look like a stupid jerk right off the bat. But I\'ve
spent my life. I\'ve trained over 50,000 therapists with my workshops in
the United States and Canada, evident two day workshops for therapists
and four or five day workshops for therapists. I\'ve, you know, been
teaching at Stanford two ever since we we came back to California. And
therapists make all kinds of horrible, horrible mistakes. And it\'s
it\'s it\'s sad. I make mistakes myself still. But I get scales from my
patients that they rape me at the end of every session. How empathic
that that I was. And the scales are very sensitive to the slightest
therapeutic failures. And how helpful was the session. And again, the
the scale is very sensitive to therapeutic errors. So when I\'m making
errors, I find out right away. So I can correct them at the next session
with with the patient. I had a patient I saw in the Stanford inpatient
unit. And I give I developed a daily cognitive therapy program for the
Stanford inpatient unit because all they were doing was
electroconvulsive therapy and medications. And once I got the program, I
did it for my volunteer work. I\'m on the volunteer faculty at Stanford.
I\'m unpaid unpaid faculty. But I love I love the teaching. So I just do
it for free. But I developed this program. And and once I got it going,
I went in once a week to kind of run the inpatient group, although it
was daily and and teach the nurses would come and see how how how to do
it, how to to work with cognitive therapy with these very severe
patients. And I remember one day I was working with a woman who had had
two horrible blows in the same week. And she was admitted for severe
depression and and suicidal urges. And one her husband told her that he
was leaving her. And and the same day she she was fired from her job.
And she had that thought, you know, I\'m a worthless human being and I I
should end my life. And at the beginning of the groups, I have all the
the patients take this brief mood survey that I\'ve developed. And they
can fill it out in 30 seconds. And then I could look at their score and
see exactly how depressed they are, how suicidal they are, how angry
they are, how anxious they are. And you know, measures like that. So I
can see right away, even I don\'t know the patients, I can see exactly
how upset everyone was. And so this woman had was very high on the
depression and suicidal urges were high and the anxiety was high and the
anger was was was was extreme. And she she said, could I help her work
with her during this session. And I was so proud of how I was doing. And
I used a powerful technique called externalization of voices and showed
her how to blow her negative thoughts out of the water. And at the end
of the at the end, I said, well, here\'s boy, I\'ve done such brilliant
work today. This is someone I could talk about in a workshop or a
podcast someday with Spencer Greenberg. I could talk about the magic I
did even with the most severe in patients in a single hour really. And
at the end, I have all the patients fell out their scores again and and
had them in to me as they\'re walking out of the the room for the
cognitive therapy group, the hour and a half group. And when she had it,
her her piece of paper to me and I looked at it, I was shocked because I
thought all of her scores would be zero on the on the depression and
anxiety. Instead, they had gone to the other extreme indicating the most
severe depression a human being could have, the worst suicidal urges a
human being can have, the worst anxiety, the worst anger she was
enraged. And that I turned the piece of paper over to over to see my
empathy ratings. And on the empathy scale goes from zero to 20. And a
score of 12 would be like what Hitler could get. Like that\'s a bet,
that would be a horrible score. Unbelievably bad. Well, I think she gave
me a zero on empathy and a zero on healthfulness. And I couldn\'t
believe it. I took her aside and I said, Margaret, this is part of a
research study and it\'s easy to get confused when you take these scales
on the mood scores. The good ones are good answers are on the left, the
zeros and on the empathy and healthfulness, the good ones are on the
right, the four, four, make could you correct it because we don\'t want
to mess up the database. And she looked at her, because I couldn\'t
believe that those were valid scores. And because she\'d, I thought
she\'d done so great. And she said, no, there\'s no mistake here,
doctor. And I said, what are you talking about? I thought it was a
fantastic session that we had. And she said, well, good for you, maybe.
And I said, what are you talking about? What, what happened? And she
said, well, when you said that I\'d had a double whammy, that really
hurt my feelings and I thought you were making fun of me. Well, I had, I
had used that expression. You\'ve lost your husband and your work, the
two sources of self-esteem. I said, that\'s like a double whammy, but
she thought I was making fun of her. And I had no idea. And I said,
let\'s sit down and talk about this. I\'m, this is just devastating. And
I can imagine how hurt and angry you feel. And took maybe five minutes
to work that through and develop that warmth and trust. But therapeutic
failures, therapists don\'t even know when they\'re acting lame. And
that, but if you, if you use these kinds of scales, the patients will be
honest with you and you\'ll find out right, right away. And if you have
the courage to do it, your patients can become your greatest teachers of
all. So for those who might have had a sort of not very good
introduction to CBT or worked with a not excellent therapist who kind of
had this idea that CBT does invalidate your feelings. Could you help
them understand the distinction between when CBT is saying that your
thoughts create your feelings, how is that different than invalidating
the fact that you know, the event really was a bad thing that happened?
Yeah, the, well, I had a colleague and come come to me for, for
emergency treatment. And she allowed me to record it. And she actually
published her sessions as a podcast. Marilyn coffee was her name,
clinical psychologist and Sumanud had a kind of pretty hard life. But
she had had just beautiful empathy skills and worked with the most
severe people. And, and was very kind and giving. But if you said,
David, I went to my doctor yesterday and he said, I have stage four lung
cancer and devastated. And because I\'ve never smoked and I feel in
perfect health. And so we, I did a live session with her. And then part
of it was, you know, first empathized and how horrible this is and how
much, you know, we all love her and care for her. And this is, she feels
devastated and 100% angry and 100% anxious and 100%, you know, lonely
and abandoned. And just awful. And, and, and I don\'t move on in this
session and tell the patient gives me an A or an A plus on empathy. And
I say, you know, after 20 minutes or so, maybe 30 minutes, what grade
would you give me on empathy in terms of understanding how you\'re
thinking, understanding how you\'re feeling and accepting you and giving
you a sense of acceptance. And, and, and if you can get an A or an A
plus, then you can go on. But if you don\'t get an A, if you get an A
minus or B plus, then you still have an understood the patient. You say,
well, tell me the part, the part that I missed. But at any rate, and I
had a co therapist, Matt, Matt May, one of my former students at
Stanford, and now a superb local clinician, one of the, I think probably
one of the finest psychiatrists in the world. And I\'m certainly he is,
but we did co therapy and recorded it. And, and, and then we say, now,
you know, what, what, what would you like, like help with today? Is
there something you want help with? And she said, well, gee, all these
negative feelings and, you know, I\'m just, I\'m feeling ashamed. I\'m,
I\'m feeling devastated. I\'m, I\'m feeling hopeless. All of her
negative feelings were at 100. She had nine different categories of
negative feelings at 100 and said, well, now what, what would you like
if we could work a miracle here today? What miracle would, would you be
hoping for? And, and she said, oh, you know, she said, it\'s impossible
because something real happened, you know, the cancer is not a cognitive
distortion. And I\'m going to die. Then what would you want in the
session? She said, well, if there\'s some way that I could, I could at
least be not feeling so down and, and, and, and horrible. And then
before we try to bring about that, I said, suppose, suppose we have a
magic button. If you pressed it, all of your negative thoughts and
feelings would instantly disappear with no effort. And you\'d go into a
state of, of, of euphoria. Would you press that magic button and just
like every patient, she said, oh, I press it in a heartbeat. And I said,
well, we don\'t have a magic button, but I do have some pretty magical
techniques and probably could give you a tremendous, tremendous relief
today. Maybe make all of your negative feelings disappear, but I don\'t
think that would be such a good idea. And she said, well, why not?
Because that\'s what I need, David. And I said, well, but, but you see,
maybe these negative feelings are actually showing something beautiful
and awesome about you. And your core values as a human being, and maybe
they\'re, they\'re helpful to you in, in some way. And why don\'t we
take a look at that before we try to make them disappear? And then what,
what is your sadness show, Maryland about you? That\'s beautiful and
awesome. And she said, well, maybe it, it shows my love of life. Never
married or found a partner, a loving partner in her life, but she had a
very close contact with, you know, with her, with her dog, with, with
people who were struggling, who, who, she would help. She was a devout
Catholic. And used to go to Masses every day and, all was given and
she\'d go to meditation retreats. She says, it shows my, my, my love
for, for life. And I said, is that true? She said, absolutely. I said,
is that important? She said, absolutely. And then you\'re, you\'re very
angry. What, what, what, what is your anger show about you that\'s
positive and, you know, awesome. And one of her negative thoughts was, I
think I\'ve been duped by some of my spiritual mentors. I think they
were frauds. That\'s some of these Catholic priests. And I said, well,
you\'re 100% angry. What, what does that show about you? And she said,
well, maybe it shows my sense of integrity, my sense of fairness and the
fact that, that I\'m willing to, to stick up for myself. And on and on.
And what, what\'s great about your, your anxiety or 100% anxious if you
press the magic button, it\'ll disappear. And she said, well, maybe my
anxiety is going to keep me on my toes. So I\'ll, I\'ll go to doctors.
I\'ll get the best treatment I can. I\'ll stay alive as long as, as long
as I can. And I said, at, you know, absolutely what a beautiful thing
that is. And what is your gailton shame show about you? Well, shows I
have a moral compass. What, what is your loneliness show? She said,
well, my loneliness shows my love for, for people. And suddenly we had a
list of 20 beautiful things that her negative feelings showed about her.
And they were real powerful, big things. You see, so we weren\'t telling
her her negative feelings were, were rubbish, but quite the opposite
that her depression, her anxiety, her anger, her guilt, her shame, her
loneliness and hopelessness were showing beautiful things about her. And
then said, well, gosh, Marilyn, why would you want to press that magic
button? Because you\'ll, you\'ll go into a state of euphoria. But then
all these, and all your negative feelings will go down the toilet. But
all these beautiful qualities will go down the toilet. Is that what you
want? She said, oh, no, no, that wouldn\'t be right. And I should feel
sad. This is a appropriate to feel, sad. It would be ridiculous if I
didn\'t feel sad. I just found out I\'m going to die of cancer. And so,
say, I was supposed we had a magic dial and we could dial these feelings
down, instead of making them disappear. And how, how sad would you want
to feel? She said, well, maybe 15 out of 100 instead of 100 out of 100
would be enough. And it\'s great. Well, I put that down. That\'s your
goal for, for sadness and depression, 15%. How anxious do you want to
feel? She said, well, maybe 10% would be enough. And she re-rated her
goal for all of these negative feelings. And most of them, she wants a
little bit of that feeling, but not 100%. And that\'s a technique I\'ve
developed called positive reframing. And it honors the patient\'s
negative feelings, rather than telling the patient, you know, you
shouldn\'t feel that way or this shows what\'s wrong with you. See,
strengths have been trained to tell therapists your depression is
because of what\'s wrong with you. But with the new approach that I\'ve
developed in the last 10, 15, 20 years, we\'re going in the opposite
direction. And before we take the negative feelings away, we actually
argue for the patient to maintain those negative feelings. They\'re
beautiful. It\'s not because of what\'s wrong with you. It\'s because of
what\'s right with you. And paradoxically, that opens up the door for
rapid change. And that was a long way of saying it, but a grain with you
that you never want to be interacting with the patient to make them feel
like they\'re foolish or that there\'s something wrong with them, but go
in the opposite direction. And then we ask, now, what are you telling
yourself? What are the thoughts? You see, it\'s not this event. Even
cancer is not the cause of your depression. It\'s what you\'re telling
yourself. What are you telling yourself, Marilyn? And she said, well,
I\'m telling myself that I\'m a failure as a human being because I never
found a life partner. And there must be something wrong with me because
I lost a wasted a lot of my time being an alcoholic and drinking. And
also, I\'m a failure because I\'m beginning to doubt the existence of
God. And she had all these negative thoughts. And they were at the same
damn distortions that I had when I was upset or that you had when
you\'re upset. And then we were able to work on them. I said, now,
you\'re calling yourself, you\'re a failure because you never found a
loving partner. And would you say that to someone else, Marilyn, who you
were counseling? Would you say, oh, you\'re a failure because you never
found a loving partner? She said, no, I\'d never say that to somebody
that that would be cruel. I say, say, but you\'re saying that to
yourself. What would you say to someone else who\'s just like you? She
said, I would tell them that it\'s sad that you never found a life
partner that doesn\'t make you a failure. You were gay. You were abused
when you were little. You\'ve had a hard life. And you\'ve given a lot
of love to people. You have a lot to be proud of. You\'ve got a
master\'s degree in theology. You\'ve gotten five master\'s degrees. And
you\'ve also gotten a PhD in clinical psychology. You\'ve been involved
in environmental movements. You\'ve gone to South America to help
indigenous people who were struggling. You have a lot to be proud of.
And I say, yeah, and are those things true of you, Marilyn? She says,
yeah, I\'m talking about myself. And then Tears came to her eyes because
she was being kind to herself. And she suddenly saw it that it was her
thoughts. The cancer is something that\'s bad enough. But your suffering
is because you\'re beating up on yourself. You\'re being mean to
yourself. And she said, wow, I\'m feeling better. And she said, well,
how can I talk back to this thought, Dr. Burns, that I\'m a failure
religiously, because I\'m losing my belief in the afterlife. I don\'t
know if there\'s going to be an afterlife. And I\'m supposed to believe
that. What could I talk to myself? And I said, well, Marilyn, I\'ll tell
you, I\'ve never told you this before. But once when I was jogging home
from the strange station in Philadelphia, God came to me in a vision.
And God said, David, if you believe in me, I\'m going to be God damn
disappointed in you. And I said, don\'t worry, big guy. I\'ve got your
back. Marilyn caught the joke and started laughing. And it was just a
great moment to share with her. Again, she was just being so ridiculous.
I said, Mother Teresa lost her belief in God through much of her career.
And any religious person who believes in God all the time is a fraud or
a fool. God would never want us to be doing that. And she saw it. At the
end of this session, all of her scores went to zero. And this happened.
This really happened. I\'m just not bullshit. And it\'s recorded on one
of my feeling good podcasts, one of the earliest ones we had. And it was
a beautiful thing. And she outlived her prognosis. You know, by quite a
few years, she used to come down to Stanford from Oakland, California
for a chemotherapy because they had the best, best at Stanford. And then
we\'d go out to lunch and stuff like that. And we finally lost her about
a year ago. She never died of the cancer. She died of the stroke. But
she was a beautiful person. It\'s a gift to be able to give her the gift
of self-love and joy. And every day when I go out on my jog or my walk
from my exercise, I talk to her, tell her I still love her and think
about her. I talked to my cat, Obie, who died, who I love to. He changed
my life also. He was one of the best friends I ever had. Obie. But
anyway, that\'s how it works. You have to honor people. And you have to
be a technician with clever techniques. And we\'ve developed many
techniques to help people crush these thoughts that make our lives
miserable. But you have to have kindness and compassion too. And so
that\'s this kind of new team CBT that I\'ve developed. And I wrote
about that in my last book, Feeling Great, if anyone wants, they could
look it up on Amazon. But has all of this new positive reframing stuff
that has made the treatment even way more powerful than the early
versions of cognitive therapy. Now I\'ve got the job of trying to
convince the world, well, cognitive therapy was good in its day, but
there\'s something way better now. And so that\'s my latest, latest
campaign. It\'s not an easy campaign. By the way, it\'s hard to get
people to change their minds about an approach that the problem, for the
reason you mentioned, were limitations with cognitive therapy that were
very real. Yeah, you\'re a victim of your own success. You helped spread
CBT so successfully. But you know, one thing that really comes across
talking to you is just that you are a person of tremendous empathy and
compassion. And I wonder if, you know, yes, you have all these technical
things you bring to this table, all these techniques you learn that help
people. But also you just bring this incredible compassion. I wonder if
that just gives you a competitive advantage. Yeah, it does. And I had to
learn it, because I didn\'t come naturally to me. And I\'ve learned it a
lot from some of my students who now work with me. Yeah, I have, I
teach, I have a co-teacher with the Stanford or free Stanford training.
If any of you were a therapist and you want training, you just, you
know, contact me and you\'d be welcome to join our weekly training
group. But she\'ll love it. She\'s a clinical psychologist. She\'s the
one I told you I hiked with this morning, because we hadn\'t working
virtually. And so it was fun to see her in person. But she, she\'s a,
you know, a brilliant clinical psychologist. Her dad was one of my
classmates at Amherst. So she\'s a generation behind me, but really,
really brilliant. And but also compassionate. And so I do a lot of
co-therapy with her. And so I kind of model the kindness and the words
that she uses that can convey that. But the, if you have, if you convey
compassion and warmth to a patient that you\'re, that\'s 90% of the
battle, but you have to have more than just, just that. You could be the
kind as person in the world. And your patients could give you a perfect
empathy scores. But if you didn\'t have the techniques to help them
identify the distorted thoughts and techniques to change those thoughts.
And also to give them the motivation to crush those thoughts, you won\'t
get very far. You have to bring many, many skills to the table. And
that\'s kind of why I\'ve been working on this feeling good app, because
I\'ve, I\'ve realized that probably of the 50,000 people I\'ve trained,
you know, with, I mean, trained, I\'d say someone who spent at least two
days in one of my full day, you know, two full days with me and learning
cognitive airpire, the new team CBT. There\'s probably only been 10 or
15 who have been able to learn it. I\'ve illustrated it on this program.
We only 10 or 15 out of many thousands, have been able to learn it. They
have developed the same, the same level of skill. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It
means, you know, a lot of people are doing it. There\'s a feeling,
there\'s a feeling good institute in Mount Vucalifornia. And they
probably have 40 or 50 therapists associated with them. But there are,
why range of skill levels and the ones like may or the ones when I work
with people, I think you should be able to complete a course of
treatment for depression in a single therapy session. It has to be two,
it takes me two hours to do it, but it happens. That\'s a pretty amazing
claim, right, that you could treat someone in two hours. I mean, yeah,
yeah. And when I was young, I would have thought it was impossible. And
I used to dream about it and say, would there be some way to get really
good at psychotherapy? And I said, we\'d have to measure things and
nobody\'s measuring anything because athletes, when they practice like
for basketball, every time they throw the ball up, they can see whether
or not it goes through the hoop. So they learn really fast, but we
weren\'t measuring anything. And I did a research study at Stanford
inpatient unit to see how accurate therapists are and understanding how
their patients feel. I gave you an example where my judgment of the
patient was way off, but I had the scales that told me that immediately
at the end of the session so I could correct the error. And that\'s how
my own skill has developed so rapidly because I\'ve ever since 1980,
I\'ve never had a single patient that I didn\'t measure their depression
level and other things at every single therapy session and that
information. And I wanted to get better and better. And so I\'ve changed
the methods and change the methods and changed my approach until now the
my skill level has become massively beyond what it was when I was a
young man doing, you know, psychiatric residency training at one of the
top training centers in the world, but we weren\'t taught anything that
had value that I was aware of. And I learned it along the road, you
know, working with people and the measurements, I measure things at the
start and end of every single therapy session. So I can see how are you
feeling right now at the start of the session? How are you feeling right
now? How depressed? How anxious? How angry at the end of the session?
And that\'s how I first began to see that it\'s possible with some
patients to get almost a complete elimination of their feelings,
negative feelings in a single session. Then you\'ve got to do relapse
prevention training because the negative feelings will certainly come
back. So you teach the patient how to deal with them when they come
back. That\'s pretty easy. But then once I saw that I could get this
occasionally, then I learned how to get it, you know, most of the time.
It\'s not 100% of the time, but I would say it\'s 90, 90% of the time.
And that\'s why I\'m so excited about this innovation in the therapy
that we\'ve been developing and at my group, with my group at Stanford.
Have you ever found yourself struggling to remember an interesting
takeaway from a podcast you listened to last month? Have you ever
considered how much valuable information you\'ve consumed and then
forgotten in the past year? We tend to think we\'ve learned something as
soon as we\'ve seen it once, but the harsh truth is that we forget
pretty much everything unless we use it repeatedly. ThoughtSaver is a
free tool that was created to solve this exact problem. Every day,
ThoughtSaver emails you a quick flashcard quiz designed to help you
remember the things you care about. If you\'re not sure where to start,
ThoughtSaver has some ready-made decks of flashcards across a wide range
of topics that can get you started learning many interesting and
important concepts. Or if you\'ve already got ideas in mind, you can
dive right in and start making your own decks of cards. Just start using
this powerful free tool and begin strengthening your recall of important
ideas head to ThoughtSaver.com. So could you break down how it works?
You already talked about the positive reframing aspect where you think
about your emotions as reflecting your values and you think about what
level do you really want that emotion? And you also talked about the
feedback loop, making sure to collect the data at every session of how
they\'re doing. What are the other aspects to team that you think are
innovations on top? Yeah, well it\'s a real simple thing. T is testing E
is empathy, A is called either agenda setting or assessment of
resistance, whatever you want to call it, and M is methods. And that\'s
the linear order that we do things. So we started the beginning of the
session before the session begins. The patient takes my brief mood
survey, which is how are you feeling at this moment? And it takes them
about 30 seconds to fill it out. And then I see their scores at the
beginning of the session and I can see how depressed they are on a zero
to 100 scale, how suicidal they are, how anxious they are, how angry
they are. And these scales are like 95 to 98 percent accurate. They\'re
amazingly precise and correct. And if it\'s a voluntary patient, they
give you the true information. I empathize. And I gave you an example of
how I did that with with Maryland coffee. And we train patients in the
Tuesday group. I mean therapists, we have very rigorous empathy training
techniques so that therapists can learn to get to perfect empathy with
almost any patient within 30 minutes of the first time you meet with the
patient. So what that means to the patient gives you an A. And not that
you give yourself an A. Because your way you grade yourself will rarely
be similar to the way the patient grades you. So it\'s how does the
patient feel, how you\'re doing? How do you teach people the empathy?
That might surprise the listener. How do you actually learn that? Well,
the way I do, it\'s pretty challenging. I would say for the therapist
and they don\'t all have the courage to do this type of thing. But in
the Tuesday group, I might say, what is the most critical challenging,
threatening, patient, imaginable? What would that person say to you or
what have patients said to you? And they listen to things like, oh,
patients tell them things like, oh, you don\'t really care about me.
You\'re not really helping me. You don\'t really understand how I feel
inside things of that nature. And then we teach the therapist what
sounds easy, but it isn\'t. It\'s something called the five secrets of
effective communication. And these are five communication techniques you
can use in response to anything a patient says or a spouse says, if you
don\'t remember anybody, I train them on the worst things that someone
might say to them because if you can handle that, you can handle
anything. And the techniques are, it\'s EAR, empathy assertiveness in
respect. There\'s three empathy techniques. That\'s the disarming
technique, which means finding truth in what the patient says, even if
it seems unfair or exaggerated. And it\'s based on what I call the law
of opposites. And the law of opposites is, if you agree with a hostile
criticism and you genuinely agree that it\'s totally correct, the person
will instantly stop believing that. And that\'s a paradox. So let me
repeat it. If someone gives you a horrible criticism, like let\'s say
it\'s someone on the inpatient unit who\'s been involuntarily
hospitalized and say a teenager who\'s trying to get out of the hospital
to kill some honor, to kill themselves. And they might shout at you,
you\'re a jerk. You don\'t care about me. You\'re like a probation
officer, something like that. And you know, what could the inpatient
doctors say? How could you agree with that? Did you see? Because if you
agree with it, the person will stop believing it. So you might say to
something, you know, I feel the same way you do. I absolutely haven\'t
been helpful to you. I haven\'t been understanding how you\'re feeling
inside. And I really am kind of like in the role of a probation officer.
And I hated as much as you do. It\'s not the way I want to relate to
you. And I can imagine you\'re mad at me and pissed at me and pissed at
the inpatient unit. You\'re here involuntarily. And you want me to let
you out. And yet, I understand you told the nurses this morning you want
to get out so you can kill yourself. Get out of the hospital. And I can
tell you that I care about you. And if I let you out and you killed
yourself, I don\'t think I could live with myself. But at the same time,
I\'m feeling pretty stupid like I really haven\'t done a good job with
you. And you have every right to be pissed off at me. That would be like
the disarming technique. And when you say something like that, the
patient melts in your hands. Here is somebody\'s finally listening,
finally hearing me. But that\'s the disarming technique. And it\'s like
a magical technique. But it\'s hard to learn because it requires the
death of the therapist\'s ego or a normal person can do it. You don\'t
have to be a therapist, but it requires the death of the self. That\'s
one of the four great self, great deaths that the Buddha talked about.
Well, he just talked about the great death, but there\'s actually four
great deaths. And this is the death of your ego to hear the anger
that\'s being directed at you. Another thought in feeling epithetia
paraphrasing the patient\'s words, acknowledging how the patient is
probably feeling based on the words you\'re saying I don\'t understand
you. And you\'re right, I\'ve done a shitty job of that. And I can
imagine how angry you might be feeling and hurt and kind of
disillusioned. Tell me more about that. Am I on the right page? Am I
reading you right right now? And that would be like thought empathy,
repeating their words, feeling empathy, acknowledging their feelings and
inquiry. Am I getting it right? Those would be the three empathy
techniques disarming, thought and feeling empathy and inquiry. And then
there\'s, I feel statements would be assertiveness, sharing your own
feelings. Like I feel really sad and a bit ashamed to realize that I\'ve
failed you so badly, but you\'re right. And at the same time, I\'m
thinking that this could be a chance for us to develop the kind of
relationship you want, the kind of relationship I want. And so with that
in mind, tell me how you\'re feeling and tell me all the things I\'ve
been saying and doing that have been turning you off and not working for
you. And problems I haven\'t been helping you with. That\'s the way we
train the therapist, but you see, so they pair off in groups of two or
three, and one plays the angry patient and attacks the therapist and the
therapist has to respond with the five secrets. And then we give them a
grade right away. Was it an A, a B, a C, a D? And they always do
terrible. And they say, well, and then we say, well, your grade was, you
know, maybe a B minus and that\'s out of kindness. We\'ll give you that
grade. But you did some things right. Here\'s what you did right. But
when you said blah, blah, blah, that\'s not going to work at all. Let\'s
try a role reversal. Try it again. We go, it\'s called deliberate
practice and we do role reversals until the therapist gets an A. That\'s
how I teach empathy. And it\'s hard because they have to be willing to
fail in front of other therapists. And they\'re all thinking that
they\'re the only one who\'s in an app. They\'re all pretty darn inept
to be honest. And if you have humility, then you can grow and learn. And
so we use the philosophy of joyous failure. What I\'m teaching in the in
the Tuesday group, you have to set your ego, check your ego at the door
and do these very challenging exercises that you\'re going to point out
your weaknesses instantly. And if you\'re willing to fail, you can learn
tremendously. That\'s so interesting. It\'s a cool way of teaching
empathy because when you think about it, it seems like such a difficult
thing to teach, but it seems like you\'ve broken it down systematically
and you have a training program where they can actually practice it. It
actually reminds me of an experience I\'ve had online where sometimes
when people will write really harsh criticisms of things I\'ve written
in a really obnoxious way, what I\'ve actually found the most effective
is just acknowledging any part of what they said that\'s true. Yeah,
that\'s right. And then very calmly just explaining why I think that
they may be mistaken in other points, but in a very polite, gentle way.
And I find that their belligerence usually goes way down. They\'ll start
really belligerent, but then when they\'re almost like take it off guard
by the kind of gentleness of my reply, and then they tend to lower the
temperature down to the level I\'m at, which works really well for me.
It just reminds me of some of the things you\'re teaching. Yeah, that
you\'re so right in what you\'re saying. It\'s an amazing phenomenon. I
had a podcast with a woman that I treated for what Howard Hughes had, a
contamination phobia, kind of obsessive compulsive disorder. And she\'d
had 25 years of washing her hands and spending two hours in the shower.
It was just dominating her life. She was afraid of doorknobs because
people would touch them and she thought she\'d get germs. And I treated
her live in one of my the Tuesday groups, my Stanford Tuesday groups, so
the student is what we do live treatment. Some people can watch and ask
questions. And it was an amazing experience in the woman at the end of
the session. Well, first we went in the women\'s bathroom and touched
all the toilets and it\'s totally freaked her out. You may have to
explain that a little more. This is who\'s not familiar. She\'s afraid
of contamination. And I use a lot of techniques with her, but one of the
keys is to confront your fear. And so so she\'d have to touch germs
where germs are instead of avoiding the way she\'s been doing. And then
after we got out of the band, I had 30 Stanford students there, you
know, in the women\'s bathroom, watching us touch the inside of the
toilet. And so that was freaking her out. I said, how anxious are you?
She said 120 on a zero to 100. I said, well, that\'s not high enough. So
let\'s walk out to the front of the building, touch all the doorknobs on
the way. And that was freaking her out. But I said, you have to do this.
And she was forcing herself to confront her fear. And we got out that
the worst thing for her was the glass door at the behavioral sciences
building at Stanford, because we\'d have all these people\'s hands on
there. And so I made her open the door. And then we went out. And there
was a trash barrel that was empty, but it was like maybe an eighth of an
inch of grime all over on the inside of it, like black gooey stuff. And
I said, here\'s the last thing I want you to put your hands in here and
get them all gooey and dirty and then rub them on your face. And she
said, no, I can\'t do that. And I said, oh, you can do that. You\'re
going to do that now. And this is where the epithet comes in, because I
knew this woman loved me that like we had, she really trusted me.
Because you can\'t do this stuff if the patient doesn\'t trust you. But
she says, no, all vomit if I do that. And I said, all the better, you
can just put your hands in there and get them all grimy and vomit all
over yourself. And then she says, no, no, you do it first. And I said,
no problem. So I stuck my hands in and then pulled them out and rubbed
them all over my face. So it was all this black stuff all over my face.
And then I said, okay, you\'re turn. So she says, I guess I have to do
this. So she stuck her hands in there, pulled them out and rubbed them
on her face. And all the students started cheering. It was so cool. And
one of them had his got out his iPhone and photographed that. I made a
30 second video of it. We went back into the behavioral sciences
building and back to the seminar room. And we all sat down. And I said,
how are you feeling? She started sobbing. I said, why are you crying?
She says, because I\'m cured, I\'m not afraid of it was like a miracle
that happened here tonight. So it was so it was so moving. But at any
rate, I had her on a podcast and to say, you know, rapid recovery is
possible for most people. Even when you think you\'re a hopeless case,
which she had thought. And then I got an email from somebody, a two word
email. And coming back to your point about when people are hostile to
you, it said, F you, as all it said. And it kind of pissed me off, to be
honest. Apparently this guy didn\'t like the idea that people could
recover rapidly and thought I was some kind of a fraud, a con artist, a
liar and probably someone who had struggled. So I wrote back to him. And
I said, sometimes my critics are my best teachers. And obviously I must
have done or said something that really angered you. And I know you have
important information to share with me. And I would appreciate it if
you\'d be my teacher and tell and teach me. And then I just got the
kindness, kindness, imaginable email back from this fellow. And he
became a huge, a huge fan. But it was just, was just what you were
saying that, but it\'s hard to do that sometimes because we want to lash
out at other people. We want to defend ourselves and get back at people
who say things that hurt, that hurt our feelings. And it\'s hard for me
sometimes too. To say the truth, I\'m human. Sometimes I, I blow it.
I\'m not always acting saintly. But if you even can act saintly part of
the time, it\'s pretty, pretty damn awesome. Well, yeah. I mean, a
therapist goes to such intense pressure, you know, in the heat of the
moment where they\'re being challenged by patient. And to do that in a
real time, I imagine is very, very challenging. Yeah. But once you get
at it, it\'s so much fun. You know, and because it\'s such a joy to be
able to respond by finding the truth and what some, someone\'s critical
of you, to find the truth and what they\'re saying and to honor them, it
just blows their mind as you pointed out a few moments ago. You\'re
going back to the story of the exposure therapy of the, of the woman who
would obsessively clean herself. You know, some people I\'ve heard, who
talking about exposure therapy, think of it as almost cruel. And I
remember you reading an article called like the cruelest cure or
something. And, and some people listening to this might think, wow, that
sounds like torture. Like you were putting this way through. You were
making you do this. So how do you think about that? How do you think
about it? You know, when is it pushing someone too hard? You know? Well,
that\'s why I\'ve developed an app because therapists, I don\'t think
you\'re going to get it. And we\'ve incorporated AI into our app now.
And the cool thing, AI is the student I was, I always dreamed about
because it learns fast and does exactly what I tell it to do. But, but
therapists can, the school of psychotherapy or the field of
psychotherapies made up of cults with cult leaders. They\'re called, you
know, like your air and backs or your Carl Young\'s or the, you know,
Fritz Pearls or these various famous people. And they\'re, they\'re
often just, you know, narcissistically trying to promote themselves. And
I guess you don\'t mind controversy on your program. Albert Ellis was
someone I really admired and he was the first one to point that out that
most nearly all of the great people in psychiatry and psychology are
kind of sick puppies. The sociopathic or narcissistic exploitative
people. So people get these ideas that they know the answer. But
exposure therapy, 80% of therapists in the United States refuse to use
exposure therapy for the reason that you mentioned. They think it\'s
some form of insensitivity and cruelty. And of course, any powerful
technique has the potential to hurt as much as the potential to heal.
And so you\'ve got to have courage as a therapist and you have to
combine compassion with powerful techniques. Take the woman that I just
described to you. The few minutes of intense anxiety ended 25 years of
daily all day long misery. What a good deal is that. And she\'s been
great ever since that session. She she\'s followed me to workshop. She
came all away from California just to attend a workshop. I did in
Atlanta. And so she could go up on the stage and have people watch her
rubbing her heads on the floor and rubbing them on her face and telling
people how great it was to be liberating. But exposure therapy is is is
just one technique of maybe a hundred, a hundred and twenty five
techniques I use. And but it has its its place. I\'ve myself had
probably 17 anxiety disorders myself starting from childhood. And so I
know you know, I\'ve had phobia of blood when I was young. I was afraid
of bees, horses, dogs, heights. I\'ve had crippling public speaking
anxiety, all kinds of social anxiety. And anything that anxious patient
has, I can say, Oh, I\'ve had that too. I know how much that sucks. And
what a joy it\'s going to be to show you how to overcome that anxiety.
Because I\'ve I\'ve been there myself and I know I know how to solve
that. And patients love love hearing that. But there\'s a lot of ways to
to treat anxiety. A lot of techniques, but exposure has to be a part of
the solution. But for example, let\'s say you\'re you\'re trying to
treat someone with social anxiety without having them talk to strangers.
Is there a afraid of doing that? Well, how could you say they\'re cured
if they won\'t talk to strangers? I go out with them and say, Let\'s go
talk to strangers together. I\'ll do it with you. Let\'s get over this
fear today. Let\'s make it happen now. But it takes courage and and
compassion. But it kind of frosts me when therapists take these highly
opinionated positions on things. Oh, that\'s awful. That\'s a cruel
cure. You know, well, you don\'t know what the hell you\'re talking
about, buddy. And now I sound opinionated, but it\'s kind of like
opinionated. When I was younger, I went to CBT therapist or guys, I
think I was just saying cognitive behavioral therapist who had me go to
bars at night completely alone. And he would give me homework like,
okay, you\'re going to introduce yourself to five strangers. Oh, yeah.
This was terrifying for me. Like my heart would pound in my chest. I
felt like I was going to die. But I believed him. This was that, you
know, it\'s sort of pushing through the fear was I believe deep down
that that was going to get me to the other side. So I would force myself
to do it. And it was incredibly powerful for me. Like after doing this a
bunch, I now feel like I\'m at the point where I\'m less afraid than the
average person. Oh, yeah. Well, look at you\'ve got a fantastic podcast
with thousands of people listening to you every week. It\'s really, it
really is transformative sometimes, but also terrifying. And I think on
a broader level, I feel like one of the most powerful heuristics in my
whole life that I\'ve ever developed was that I\'m going to always try
not to let fear hold me back from doing something valuable. Right? Like
of course, of course, there are times when you should be afraid of
things, right? It\'s dangerous or whatever. But it\'s really about
understanding when, okay, I\'m afraid, but this thing is worthwhile. And
so I\'m not going to let the fear stop the worthwhile thing, right? So
I\'m totally sold on BBCNC, but I also get why people are scared to do
it, and why, you know, and also if done badly, how could I back
consequences? Like I suspect if halfway through with that patient, you
know, she\'d run out of the of the building screaming and then never
called you. Yeah, that would have been very bad, right? Yeah, I didn\'t
tell you the first part of the story, but yes, you you\'ve got to have
an agenda with the patient and you\'ve got to have the trust of the
patient. You\'ve got to do it collaboratively. But before I took her out
to confront her fear, I told her a little summary of my favorite Rod
Serling Twilight Zone in the group. I did you ever watch that TV show? I
see a few episodes. There was this one about, it\'s my favorite episode
and it had an elderly woman in an apartment building. And this
supervisor comes in and says, listen, lady, we\'re tearing this building
down. All the other people here have left. And you\'re the only one left
and we\'ve got to tear it down today and so you\'ve got to get out of
here. And she says, no, no, I\'m not going to leave this this apartment
building. And you know, they kind of she explains to him why she says,
ever since I\'ve been a little girl, I\'ve been able to see Mr. Death.
Other people can\'t see him. I don\'t know why, but I saw him once as a
little girl. And when he touches you, you die. And I saw him on a bus
once and no one else could see him and he went up and he touched a
fellow who immediately died. And ever since I\'ve been determined, I\'m
not going to let Mr. Death touch me because I can recognize him. And if
I go outside of this building, and I haven\'t left this building for
years and years, and if I go outside, I know he\'s going to come and
touch me and I\'m going to die. And that\'s why I\'m not going to leave
the building and this construction superintendent gets discussed and
says, listen, lady, I\'ll be coming back. We\'re coming back this
afternoon. We\'re going to tear down this building. You\'ve got to get
out of here. And he\'s kind of storms off angrily. And then she hears
this wailing sound outside her door, help, help. And she opens the door,
but there\'s a chain on it to look out. And it\'s this police officer in
the snow, fallen in the snow. And he says, help, I\'ve been shot, help.
And she says, oh, no, no, you\'re not going to trick me. I think you\'re
probably missed Mr. Death. And he says, no, no, please help me. I\'m in
pain. I\'m cold. Please help me. So she consents. It\'s Robert Redford.
That was the actor, maybe no one. And your fans won\'t remember. But
he\'s like, ultra-handsome guys. And so she says, oh, okay, I\'ll let
you in if you\'re not Mr. Death. And he\'s, oh, oh, no, I\'ve just I\'ve
been hurt. And he has her lie down on her bed in this little tiny
apartment. And she makes some tea for him. And she\'s comforted. And
she\'s helping this police officer. And then the superintendent comes
back in. And she doesn\'t want to open the door. She gets thinking,
maybe he\'s Mr. Death. But finally, he rips the door open and comes in.
And says, lady, we\'re tearing it down now. And you\'ve got to go. And
then she says, no, I can\'t because this police officer on my bed is is
injured. And I can\'t leave him here. And then the superintendent says,
what what police officer? I don\'t see any police officer. You get out
of here. And he storms off angrily. And then she looks in the mirror and
she sees her bed reflected in the mirror. And there\'s no one on it. And
she realizes that police officer is actually Mr. Death. And then she
says, you tricked me. You tricked me. And she says, am I am I going to
die now? You know, and he reaches out his hand to her. And he says,
there\'s no loud sounds. There\'s no pain involved. And in fact, it\'s
already happened. And he takes her hand and she looks on the bed. And
she sees her dead body on the bed. And he says, our adventure has just
begun. And they and he takes her hand and they walk out kind of in a
romantic way. This elderly woman and this young Robert Redford to type a
guy. And the story, the meaning of the story is that, you know, she
confronts this fear she\'s had at the fear of death. And she discovers
there\'s nothing there even to fear. And she\'s going to have this
beautiful, beautiful experience. And I told her this story before we
went out and I said, now, are you ready to die? Because you have to die
to be cured of your OCD and your contamination phobia. So I she said,
and then I reached out my hand to her. I said, are you ready now? She
took my hand. And then I I knew that she trusted me. And it was it was
the time to do it. But you have to have that that love and a connection
with your patient. And if you just go and start throwing exposure
techniques at patients, sure they\'ll freak out. But it\'s not because
the exposure is dangerous. It\'s just because you\'re a crappy
therapist. And you didn\'t know how to develop a warm trusting
relationship. I\'ve never run into any resistance with exposure or a bad
outcome. But I\'ve never done exposure without a clear agenda with the
patient and the trust that this this is what we\'re going to do. And
this is how we\'re going to change your life. I\'m actually finished
going through all the letters of team and how they so I think we talked
about empathy testing empathy and the agenda setting. In other words,
the the elimination of the resistance, the patient\'s resistance, where
we see that they\'re what you thought was your symptoms is actually
symptoms of a mental disorder is actually what\'s beautiful and awesome
about you. Your core values. And then once the patient sees that and
dials down their goal for their negative feelings, then we go into
methods and I take a negative thought like I\'m not as good as I should
be. Or I\'m a loser or whatever it happens to be. I\'m a hopeless I\'m a
hopeless case. And then I just use techniques one after another to crush
that thought we start out identifying the distortions in the thought
explaining the distortions maybe use a technique called the experimental
technique or externalization of voices or the double standard technique.
Just techniques like would you say this to someone else? Yeah, like
that\'s the one I used with Maryland coffee. And it just worked really
beautifully to her. And in the early days of cognitive therapy before we
had these techniques to eliminate resistance or reduce resistance, I
used to have to try 10, 15, 20 techniques before I could find the one
that worked for a patient. Now with the the the new elimination of
resistance techniques, generally three or four or five or six techniques
at most that that when we get to that methods phase and the patient can
smash their first negative thought, just blow it out of the water,
reduce the belief in it to zero. And once they\'ve crushed one negative
thought, they might have written down on their daily mood log, you know,
eight or 10 negative thoughts, then I go into something called
externalization of voices where I become their negative self and attack
them with their permission, with their negative thoughts. And they can
generally just then blew them all out of the water if they get stuck on
one, we do a role reversal. And that part of the session usually only
takes 15, 20 minutes and then their symptoms are gone. I say now how do
you feel? How how depressed are you? You wanted to go from 120. How are
you? How depressed are you at this moment? And they jump zero. It\'s
completely gone. And how anxious are you? Oh zero. How guilty and
ashamed are you? Five out of 100. How inattentant? What worthless do you
feel? Oh, you know zero. They\'re they\'re their feelings just fall
pretty much down into the basement at that point. They go beyond what
goals that they had and bring most of them down to zero or very small
levels. And that\'s it. And then I do relapse prevention training, which
takes about 20 minutes. It could be at the next session or at the end of
the first, you know, session. I just sometimes I wait a day or two and
then do the brief relapse prevention training. And then they\'re done.
And that\'s how it works. And what do you teach during the relapse
prevention? Well, there\'s three things. First, I say it\'s a hundred
percent certainty that you\'re going to relapse. No one is entitled to
be happy all the time. All your entitled to us five happy days per week
and two miserable days. And if you don\'t have your five happy days, you
need a tune up. So you better call me and come back for a little mental
tune up. But if you don\'t have your two miserable days, you\'re getting
too happy. So that\'s a concern also. But they went I say when when when
you relapse, it could be tomorrow. It could be three weeks from now. It
could be anytime. But everyone has the same exact thoughts. You\'ll tell
yourself my improvement was just a fluke. The treatment wasn\'t wasn\'t
real. Burns is a fraud. I\'m a hopeless case after all. I\'m worthless
after all. This proves that the therapy didn\'t work. And I have them
write those thoughts down on a piece of paper, then identify the
distortions in them because right now they\'re feeling happy. So it\'s
easy for them to crush those thoughts. For example, instead of telling
yourself, this proves that the therapy didn\'t work. You can they might
come up with a thought. No, the therapy was amazingly helpful. But last
night I had a fight with my partner, went to bed angry. And I woke up
today feeling worthless and miserable and hurt and alone. And maybe
it\'s time for me to pick up the tools again and use them. And then I
say, how how is that? Well, they say, oh, that\'s tremendous. You know,
and they can easily crush these thoughts when they\'re in a good mood
before it comes. And I roleplay the thoughts with them and say, no, I\'m
your negative self. And I want you to know that you know, that the
treatment didn\'t work because you\'re so depressed today. The treatment
was was superficial. It wasn\'t deep enough. And then see if they can
crush it. Maybe they can say, no, the treatment was fantastic. My only
mistake is listening to your bullshit right now. It\'s I\'m upset. I
have a right to be upset. And I\'m going to see what I can do to deal
with this situation. And I have plenty of tools to deal with that. I
have one thing I can tell my my partner that I love them and that I felt
badly about our argument. And let\'s let\'s talk it over. And and I can
also talk back to these ridiculous distorted thoughts I\'m having right
right now. So that that that\'s how that\'s how it goes. And it\'s
there. It\'s easy for them to do that. And I have them record that on
the cell phone as the easiest way and say now when when you relapse,
make sure you have this recording available so you can listen to it. And
if you have any trouble, just call me and you can come in for a tune up.
I give I give lifetime guarantees on my work. I\'ll give you three
unlimited tune ups for the rest of your life if you ever need me again.
And I hope you will because if you don\'t relapse and need me, I\'ll
never see you again. And I\'ve really come to like you and feel very
proud of you and affection towards you. And I\'m sad to lose you now,
but I wouldn\'t have it any other way because you\'re feeling joy now.
And that\'s that\'s the greatest greatest thing for me to have you
recover really rapidly. And the 40,000 hours of patience I had, I don\'t
think more than eight or ten ever contacted me for for tune ups. So it
it seemed it seemed very effective. And when they did, I remembered
them. It was just like I had, you know, a guy called me not long ago who
I had seen for 35 years. He also had severe OCD. But he called me not
not not for a tune up, but because he wanted to use my anxiety, failing
his research. He\'d become this very famous researcher from the National
Institute of Health. But I, you know, I miss my patience. And the ones
that were the toughest to treat that were the most critical of me and
who then turned their lives around, you know, I miss them. Sometimes
they wish I could call them and say hello. Do you remember me?
Especially like if they treated them when they were a suicidal teenager
or something like that, who really tough. You know, I grew so fond of
all the patience that I ever had. But you have to let them go. You
can\'t be, you know, calling them on the telephone. It would be like
unethical or something. Was the average number of sessions that you find
you needed the patient to help with depression or anxiety? Well, for me,
it\'s just one, one, two hour session. My colleagues, my some of my
students who are the real, have developed tremendous expertise, say that
they\'ll typically see patients for three or four or maybe five
sessions. And it\'s a problem for them economically because their
patients get better so fast. So it\'s hard to keep their practice full.
If you have the old-fashioned thing where people just come and talk to
you for hours and months and years or even a decade or more, you don\'t
need to get new patients. But the, you have to get a lot of new patients
with these new techniques because they work so rapidly. But it generally
works out because the word gets around that so and so has these
phenomenal, phenomenal skills. So they get it start building, you know,
a tremendous following after, you know, a year or two and the word get
gets around. With our feeling good app, which we hope to be releasing
probably in October or November and through there. And we\'re doing beta
tests. If any listeners want a beta test, you know, it\'s free and
it\'ll always be free if people can\'t afford it. We see pretty
tremendous improvements in people with the, with the feeling good app
and roughly two days. We see like a 50 to 60 percent reduction in seven
negative feelings, feelings of depression, anxiety, guilt, shame,
loneliness, hopelessness, anger. But that was, it are pre-artificial
intelligence phase with the app. We\'re now creating artificial
intelligence David in the app. And it\'s hard to say, to tell the
difference between being treated by me live and being treated by the app
that we\'re training because it\'s learned to do kind of exactly what I
do. It just works faster than I do. And so we\'re, we haven\'t beta
tested it yet. We\'ll be beta testing it within the next few weeks. But
that I think could be a real game changer for the for psychotherapy, for
people all over the world because the app is going to be inexpensive,
very inexpensive and scalable. Now we\'re not allowed to say that it\'s
a treatment for depression and it\'s not. It\'s just a self-help tool at
the current time. It seems to have a tremendous promise in helping
people with negative feelings. And we\'re just trying to help people.
We\'re not trying to treat metal disorders with the app. We\'re just
trying to help people reduce and eliminate negative feelings and boost
positive feelings. But we\'ll see because it\'s hard to get therapists
up to the level that I\'ve gotten to over 40 or 50 years of constant
feedback from patients. It\'s been a road for me to learn how to how to
do this. And it\'s hard for human therapists to learn how to do it. Some
have learned it somewhat and some have learned it very, very well. But
the the app I think is going to be able to do extraordinarily well and
opens up a new road, a new highway for the future of mankind if we
survive, if the human race survives. And my dream is always to be able
to bring this kind of rapid dramatic changes to people all over the
world who care to afford therapy and even if you could afford it, you
can\'t find anyone who can help you. And that\'s kind of what my life\'s
goal has been. Science is built on replication. Our confidence that a
particular hypothesis is true increases. The more times we can conduct
experiments and get results that are consistent with the original
research. Unfortunately, psychology and other social science fields have
been undergoing a replication crisis for the past several years, meaning
that researchers have tried but failed to replicate experimental results
from the past few decades. And this is deeply troubling because it calls
into question many of the things we thought we knew about how humans
work. To help solve this replication crisis in psychology, the team at
Clearer Thinking has launched a project called Transparent Replications
that seeks to celebrate high quality research while also shifting
incentives toward more replicable, reliable methods. They accomplished
this by conducting rapid replications of recently published psychology
and human behavior studies in prominent academic journals, with the aims
of celebrating the use of open science best practices, improving
reliability, and promoting clarity. Once the Transparent Replications
team has completed a replication, they make their results freely
available on their website for anyone to read. To read those results and
other essays by the team, visit replications.clearthinking.org. What do
you think the role is for SSRIs in treating depression? I think they
have no effects other than the placebo effect. That\'s based on Irving
Kirsch\'s analysis of all the data in the Food and Drug Administration,
where patients were randomly assigned to SSRIs or to placebo. Irving
Kirsch is the associate director of the placebo research institute at
Harvard, and he has a wonderful book on that topic called The Emperor\'s
New Drugs. It\'s an easy read, popular science, you can get it on
Amazon. It\'s highly recommended. People hate it when I say this, but
I\'ve been a researcher in my life. I review articles for scientific
journals. I\'m one of the peer people that they get to point out
problems in articles. It\'s Kirsch\'s research is stone solid. The
SSRIs, I haven\'t prescribed them for 25 years. I haven\'t used an
anti-depressant. Before that, I gave them out 16,000 times to patients,
just because patients demanded them. They\'ve heard that they\'re so
good, and I didn\'t want to get sued. If they wanted them, I prescribed
them. I never saw much from them, and I\'ve never used them in the last
25 years. Do you see any role for physical exercise in mental health? Do
you think it\'s, you mentioned earlier that maybe it\'s not affected
from your point of view? It\'s not affected from my point of view, but
it also has a placebo effect. If you exercise, and you\'re telling
yourself, I\'m really doing something for my health, then you\'re going
to be feeling good. It\'s the thoughts, not the physical exercise. The
research on endorphins has shown that the whole endorphin thing was a
scam. They administered it a study I saw recently. It really did the
proof of this fact that I\'ve been claiming for years, and people get
antagonistic when I say this, because a lot of people like exercise, and
if you like exercise, God bless you, do it, and enjoy it. But they gave
a drug, randomly assigned people to two groups, and gave half of them a
drug that blocked endorphins in the brain, and then had both groups
exercise and tracked changes in their mood, and there was absolutely no
difference in the two groups, which proved that the endorphins had no
role in any improvement in exercise. I once had a man who I worked with
in the early days when people were touting exercise. He also had escaped
from Nazi Germany, and he went to New York, started Chinese shoes on the
streets of New York City, and he was alone as a teenager, and he
eventually became a multi-millionaire, and he owned several city blocks
in downtown New York, yet a manufacturing company, but he came to me as
an elderly man. He said he\'d never had one minute of happiness in his
life. He felt like a worthless human being. And so I said, well, your
problem was you\'ve got to boost your brain endorphins, and through
exercise, so I got him to running, and I got him running 12 miles a day.
He was in his late 70s, and I said, Ezekiel, how did you feel at the
start of your 12-mile run? He said, I felt like a worthless human being,
and I said, how did you feel at the end of your 12-mile run? He said, I
felt like a totally exhausted worthless human being. It didn\'t do a
thing. He could have run from New York to Los Angeles, and he would have
felt as bad. And finally, I asked him, because he\'d been to
psychiatrist his whole life, and he could afford the best, and no, he
said, he\'d been able to help him. And I said, well, Ezekiel, why do you
feel like a worthless human being? And then tears came to his eyes, and
he says, well, I\'ve been hiding this from everybody, but I feel
worthless because ever since I\'ve been a little boy, I\'ve had the fear
of the dark and claustrophobia. And I said, ah, no wonder, you know,
this guy could run for the rest of his life, and he would still feel
worthless. The exercise isn\'t going to cure that, but I told him to,
that the cure would be to go into his basement in the middle of the
night, wake up, set his alarm for 2 a.m. when it was dark, and go into
his basement, and roll himself up in a carpet. And so it\'s pitch black,
don\'t have the lights on, but have a tape, have a recording device, and
then just stay there until you\'re cured. And he fired me. He said,
that\'s stupid. That\'s horrible. I could never do that, and stormed out
of the office. And then he called me several weeks later, and he said,
Dr. Burns, I went to another psychiatrist in New York, and to find out
if you were crazy, the psychiatrist says, no, Burns is not crazy, and
you should do what he told you to do. So could I come back, and you can
tell me, you know, exactly what you want me to do, and I\'ll do it. So I
told him to do it, and then he came back the next week, and he had gone
into his basement in New York City, and in the middle of the night,
rolled himself up in the blanket, and I said, then speak out loud so we
can hear what you\'re so afraid of, you know, in the dark, and with
claustrophobia. And he said, he thought that a ghost would come out of
the darkness and sit on his chest and suffocate him. And he was 100% out
of 0 to 100 with that thought, and he kept thinking that for 20 minutes,
and he was still 100% panicky, and then he said, I suddenly said out
loud, ghost, if you\'re going to come and sit on my chest, do it now and
get it over with, I\'m sick of waiting for you. And he says, no ghost
appeared, and he suddenly started laughing, and he said he had no fear
of claustrophobia, no fear of the dark, and no longer felt like a
worthless human being. So everyone is different, and you have to target
the treatment to the exact problem, and the thoughts that the person
has, and just throwing, you know, exercise is great. You know, I try to
exercise every day, but I hate every minute of it. It\'s never given me
a runner\'s high, or even a tiny mood boost, but I do it for my health.
But I like to individualize the therapy to each person\'s specific
problem. And everyone is different, and everyone has something unique
and challenging, and requires unique creative techniques to show a
person how to get out of the trap they\'re in. Okay, next question for
you. What do you think of the so-called dodo bird hypothesis? This is a
claim that if you do randomized control trials, hitting different
therapeutic techniques against each other, that they all kind of perform
similarly. That\'s absolutely true, that\'s why I\'ve developed team
therapy because in all of the outcome studies for different forms of
psychotherapy, how much do they reduce the Beck Depression inventory
score? And all these studies are unimpressive. The most that they show
is maybe 50% of the patients that are treated for months, maybe half of
them get a 50% reduction in the Beck Depression inventory score, and
that\'s pathetic. That\'s terrible. That means the other half didn\'t
even get a 50% reduction in the Depression score. Now, I\'m not allowed
to talk about our app as having anti-depressant properties, and we\'re
not treating depression, but I can tell you that in two days, people
with the app get 60% reduction in seven different negative emotions. So
you can conclude what you like, but you\'ll get a 30% with a placebo
effect. And that\'s in most schools of therapy, they don\'t get any more
than a placebo effect, and they don\'t like to admit it. All these
schools of therapy want to think they\'re the cast pajamas for the
treatment of depression or for the treatment of anxiety disorders, but
the data does not support that, and that\'s why I\'ve been trying to
develop powerful fast-acting treatments that have effects massively
beyond placebo effects. So does that mean you don\'t think that talking
to people about therapy, which you taught in your original classic book,
Feeling Good, is better than let\'s say psychodynamic therapy in terms
of outcomes? When administered by humans, now, when people read my book,
Feeling Good, there\'s been 10 outcomes studies on that book that are
fairly encouraging. I think the Forest Gogan and research scientist in
the University of Alabama, clinical psychology researcher, many outcomes
studies just handy in my book, Feeling Good, to people. Any reported
that 50 to 60, that said before you can see your doctor for your
appointment for your depression, just read this book. And for it in four
weeks, then you can see your psychiatrist for medications, your
psychotherapy, or whatever. And then at the end of the four weeks, 50 to
65 percent of them had improved so much that they no longer wanted or
needed any professional treatment or any medications. And that\'s one of
the reasons I\'ve created the app, because I thought, wow, if the book
can do that, the app could certainly do better. And that\'s what our
beta testing has shown. But you\'ve got to be directing at your
interventions at the level of motivation, as well as cognitions, if you
want to get really fast results to melt away the person\'s resistance
and help the person see that their negative symptoms are not the result
of what\'s wrong with them, but what\'s right with them. And that\'s the
technique that seems to open the door to improvement that seems to be
vastly beyond the effects of placebo. A placebo confuses people because
if I told patients, I\'ve got this new ear tugging therapy. And all you
have to do is tug your ears three times a day, and it\'ll get those
imbalanced gases out of your ear and your depression will go away. And a
patient will leave that and did that, you know, 35% of them would be
cured of their depression in three or four or five weeks. But it\'s not
ear tugging. It\'s just their belief that something good is going to
happen. And that\'s how most schools of therapy operate. They have a
little, maybe a little punch above and beyond the placebo effect, but
not much. And that\'s why I\'ve been trying to develop something much
more powerful than that. And that\'s been my goal with my work on the
feeling good enough to see if we can make that happen. Maybe a device
can deliver to people what all these schools of therapy have tried hard,
but the human therapists are pretty limited even when supposedly highly
trained. And don\'t, to my way of thinking out of perform placebo by
much, just as the so-called anti-depressants don\'t outperform placebo
by much either. So just to clarify, make sure I understand what you\'re
saying. It sounds like you think that cognitive therapy, as taught in
your book, does significantly be placebo, but cognitive and does beat,
let\'s say, psychodynamic therapy. But cognitive therapy, as practiced
by an average practitioner, doesn\'t, is that what you\'re saying? No, I
think that the cognitive therapy practiced by the average clinician has
placebo effect and a bit more and is probably on par with reading the
book, feeling good and doing some of the exercises in there. But neither
is even the people that read feeling good, well, what happened to the
50% who didn\'t improve by reading feeling good? What was, why didn\'t
they improve? You see, that\'s the question I\'ve been trying to answer
from my, and by research and in my clinical work. And the answer seems
to be that, that, see, in feeling good, I didn\'t deal with resistance.
And most therapists do not know how to deal with, with resistance. They
keep trying to throw help at patients, and that paradoxically makes
quite a high percentage of patients resist because people don\'t like it
when people throw help at them or try to cheerlead them, just as you
gave some dramatic examples of that earlier. So then something like
seconded, anemic therapy or act or, you know, my philosophy stress
should actually, et cetera. Do you think there\'s also without performed
placebo? No, no, they won\'t. But maybe a little bit, but all of these,
the best that they can do, is just how perform placebo by a little bit.
And so I guess it\'s good if you\'ve got some improvement in some
patients, but to me, people who are depressed, they want to wake up in
the morning and say it\'s great to be alive. They don\'t want to be
feeling like 30% less depressed. One question that I wondered about just
for myself is that I found some of my beliefs have been very affected by
kind of reframing and things like that. But I find other beliefs in mind
when I\'ve tried to use techniques like that, the same thought will keep
coming back. So I\'ll feel better in the moment. I\'ll feel, oh, okay,
I\'ve done reframing around that thought, but then, maybe a day later or
a week later, it comes back again. How do you think about that? Do you
think that the reframing just wasn\'t effective enough or what would you
say to that? Well, I think that happens to everybody. I think that\'s
what it needs to be a human being. And that\'s why you\'ve got to be
prepared to pump out of those relapses, but it\'s not in the cards to
not have that happen. I think if you get really good at crushing the
negative thought that causes your relapse, like whatever it is, the
thing that\'s bugging you, if you can reduce it all the way to zero and
get really good at it, then you can get pretty good at pumping out of
those negative moods when they, I think the Buddha said, or somebody
said, you can\'t stop the birds from landing on your head, but you can
prevent them from building an nest in your hair. I don\'t think the
Buddha said that, but somebody said that. But you have to work at it. If
you tell me what your thought is, we can work on it at this moment, make
it a little bit more specific. Oh, sure. I think for me, one of the most
common recurring kinds of thoughts I\'ll have is that I might have said
something that upset someone or bothered someone, and I especially get
triggered if a friend starts acting unusually. Usually they reply right
away, but then they don\'t reply for three days, and I\'ll start
thinking, how did I say something wrong? Did I upset them in some way? I
tend to have a lot of recurring thoughts like that. Oh, yeah. I can\'t
kind of an obsession thing, type of deal. Yeah, I don\'t know. I\'m not
sure how you would define an obsession exactly. But it\'s sort of like,
I think I\'m very worried that I will hurt someone or upset someone.
Yeah. Yeah. And then if I hurt, well, I can identify that for sure,
because people used to tell me, how can you stand to see depressed
people all day long? When I was in private practice, I used to see 17
depressed patients in a row for full sessions on my last days. To me, it
was like the longer the day went on the higher I got. I loved being with
depressed people, because I had something to give them. But if I said I
heard or upset somebody during a session, it was like being shot in the
stomach with a bowling ball. So it\'s very painful, and then I\'d get
very exhausted and kind of down on myself. And if you said something
that upset or hurt someone, what would that mean to you? Why would that
be upsetting to you? And I\'m doing something now called a downward
arrow technique, and I\'m doing it on paper. I wrote, I upset or hurt
them, and I put, wrote it through a downward arrow under, and that
means, you know, it was, suppose that had happened, what would that
mean? Why is that upsetting to me? Well, two things come to mind. One is
that I\'ve had a bunch of occurrences in my life, where I\'ve
accidentally hurt someone or upset someone in my life. And then I
didn\'t realize it at the time, but then it kind of, it suddenly blew up
where they suddenly got very angry at me. And I think on some level, I
feel a little traumatized by some of those experiences, where I feel
like, oh, maybe this person\'s going to abandon me or they\'re maybe
they\'re going to be suddenly angry at me. And so I think I\'m a little
oversensitive to that. And I think the other piece for me there is that
I really care about being ethical. And so it feels to me like harming
someone is unethical and that like feels like it\'s cutting against one
of my core values. Yeah. So that\'s beautiful actually. So if I hurt
them, then they\'ll abandon me. And that would mean that I\'m unethical.
Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. I guess I would think it is two different
pieces. One, they might abandon me and two, I might have done something
unethical. Yeah. Both of those I think weigh on me. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
there\'s a couple of ways we can go with this. Yeah. So I said something
in a colleague who I really love and admire so much just got really
pissed off and said, I\'m really angry with you. And I was actually kind
of a relief because he\'s often unassertive and was actually, I was
actually good that he was saying he was angry with man. We had a meeting
today with with several of us where we\'re kind of all upset and and
talked it through and it turned out to be very productive. But I know
how painful how painful those kinds of thoughts and feelings can be. Is
this something that you that you that you want to help with? Yeah.
Absolutely. Why? Because 95% of time it\'s just in my imagination. Sure.
It\'s just, oh, they were busy or you know, it was not a big deal or you
know, it\'s just that my brain I think is like ready for that small
percentage of time where I actually really did upset someone. Sure. So
if we had a magic button and you could press it and be cured of this,
would you press the button? Well, you know, what you said earlier really
resonates with me. I wouldn\'t play it down to zero because I don\'t
think that\'s the right amount. Right. I think that one should be
conscious of their effects and others and shouldn\'t strive to notice if
they\'ve upset someone. But I think I do it maybe 90% too much. Yeah.
Push it down to 10% of what I\'m doing it at. Sure. So what, let\'s just
make a little quick list of positives and then we can do some little
externalization of voices. I don\'t know if 11.E value or go anywhere,
but it might be kind of fun. So, so, so that that\'s makes just a little
list of positives. And then oh, by the way, what are your negative
feelings when you\'re having these thoughts? You feel anxious? Yeah, I
feel anxious. I kind of will replay the the thing in my mind and I think
that kind of drives an anxiety loop where I\'m feeling tense and my
stomach might hurt. Oh, yeah. And how anxious and tense would you feel
between zero and 100? Probably 50. 50? Okay. What else? I think that\'s
the main thing. I\'ll replay the conversation sometimes like I\'ll
replay the last conversation we had and kind of go through a bit by bit
looking for a mistake I might have made. Yeah. Like, oh, wait, maybe I
maybe it was that thing. Maybe they\'re not texting me back because of
that thing I said, you know, and it\'s a it\'s an unpleasant kind of
fixated state to be. Yeah. That\'s what that\'s what I mean by
obsessing. Do you feel guilty or ashamed when you\'re thinking these
things? I think I feel a little guilty. If I think if I okay, so
sometimes I just feel like I can\'t figure it out and that like I can\'t
find anything I did that I could, you know, cause their change of
behavior. Sure. And then I\'ll feel more anxious, but if I think I hit
on something I\'m like, oh, maybe maybe that thing I said was
insensitive or something like that, then I will start feeling bad. I\'ll
feel guilty. How guilty? Between zero and 100? I think it depends on how
much I feel like I might have hurt them, but maybe 30 or 40? Okay. I\'ll
put 40, put up or level on that. Do you feel inadequate or inferior? I
don\'t. I don\'t tend to I tend to have a lot of confidence, so I don\'t
tend to feel those kinds of feelings. Do you feel sad or unhappy or down
when you\'re thinking like this? I feel sad if I start thinking, well,
maybe this relationship is damaged. Yeah, sure. Oh, this relationship
might be damaged, right? Right. And then I\'ll feel sad. Like there\'s
something that could have been lost. Yeah. And how sad? We can just
serve in the hundred. Maybe 30? 30? Okay. Any other feelings frustrated,
hopeless, alone, lonely, angry, upset, embarrassed? I don\'t think I
really feel those, but I do feel saying that maybe I don\'t know if
there\'s a word for it, but it\'s kind of the feeling like I should have
done better. I should have known better. Yeah. I should have been able
to take charge. If you will, I\'m writing this down. I\'d call that
another negative thought. I should statement. I should have done done
done better. So now what are these negative thoughts? What are and
feeling show about you that it\'s positive and awesome and how are they
helpful to you as well? What comes to mind? I think that they hopefully
they show that I really care about not hurting people. That I care about
acting ethically, that I care about these relationships being good and
that I want to avoid any kind of ruptured relationship. Yeah. So I\'m
writing down three things. You could be writing them down to these
thoughts and feelings show that I care, show that I\'m ethical, and show
that I want positive or loving relationships. Mm-hmm. Well, I think in
terms of benefits, I think it, you know, sometimes it does lead to me
realizing I did do something wrong and making amends, right? Or, or, or,
you know, noticing, hey, you know what, I could have done that better
and then I could, and then it helps me do better in the future. So I
definitely don\'t think it\'s useless. I just think I just doing it too
much, right? I\'m overly sensitive. Exactly. A lot of times or problems
are just too much of a good thing. Yeah, the, but that I can, can make
amends and it kind of keeps me on my toes, keeps me from getting
complacent. Yeah. And helps you be a better friend. Yeah. Help helps me
be a better friend. So I\'ve written down five, five positives. There\'s
probably more, but this is kind of a quick version of things. It shows
that I care. It shows that I\'m ethical. It shows that I want loving,
caring relationships. It gives me, sometimes gives me the chance to make
amends when I have screwed up. And it, it helps me be a better friend.
Does that seem accurate? Yeah, that seems accurate. And so, are these
things important? Absolutely. Are they real? Yes, I think so. Of course,
are they powerful? I would say so. Yeah. So good, good reason not to
press that magic button. But if we could redo, if we could dial them
down, how anxious would you want to feel that that was 50 percent? What,
what would be a healthy amount? I think about 10 percent, seems
reasonable. Is that, is that enough anxiety for you? I think so. Because
I feel that I just want nothing\'s idea that I\'m aware that\'s on my
radar, right? It\'s not enough that it\'s pulling me in, sucking me into
the, yeah. Great. That sounds like a good amount. How guilty do you want
to feel? Maybe with guilt. I want to, that was 40. Yeah, I think I want
to feel zero until I actually am confident I\'ve done something wrong.
Right? Like I don\'t want to preemptively feel guilt when in fact, most
of the time, maybe I didn\'t do anything wrong. Right? Okay. So zero is
on the, how sad do you want to feel? The sadness really shows your love
for other people, right? Yeah. And I think, I think, it\'s sort of like
with the guilt. Like if it turns out I did damage the relationship, then
I do want to feel sad. And maybe 40 percent is reasonable. But if I, but
I want to jump the gun, I don\'t want to pre feel sad when maybe I, you
know, didn\'t actually damage the relationship, right? I\'m just kind of
ruminating about the possibility of having damaged it. Okay. So you\'d,
you\'d want to bring the guilt and sadness from 40 down to zero and
maybe keep the anxiety from 50 down to 10, something like that. That
sounds reasonable. Yeah. Okay. Now, let that\'s, do you want to try
really a strong technique? Let\'s do it. Okay. Now, in this, in this
technique, we\'ll take turns. One will both be named Spencer. Okay. And
one of us will be the negative Spencer and one will be the positive
Spencer. And I\'ll be the, the, the negative Spencer. And I\'ll, I\'m
going to attack you with your negative thoughts. And I\'ll sound like
another person, but I\'m not. I\'m just talking to you. And I want you
to be the positive Spencer and see if you can defeat me. And, and there
are several strategies you can use, you can use self-defense, you can
use the self self-acceptance. And you can use also something called the,
the, the counter attack. And that\'ll become obvious as, as, as we work
together here, but, and, and, and if the idea is to, to, to see if we
can blow these negative thoughts out of the water, there\'s five of
them. And, and you tell me which one you want to start out on. I upset
or hurt them. They\'ll abandon me. I\'m an ethical. This relationship
might be damaged. And, and I should have done better. You know, abandon
me. Okay. Okay. Could I talk to you for a minute, Spencer? Sure. You
know who I am. Yeah. You\'re negative me, I assume. Yeah, that\'s right.
And I just wanted to remind you, in case you\'d forgotten that, that,
that, that, they\'ll, they\'re, they\'re probably going to abandon you,
Spencer. Well, the vast majority of my friends have never abandoned me.
Okay. Who won? I don\'t know. How do you think? Why not? I don\'t know,
one. I, I guess I did. You won. Okay. Did you win bigger small? Small.
Small. Let\'s, let, let, let, let\'s try a, a, a role reversal. Okay.
But by the way, that, that, that show, what, what does that show that
you won small? That I have room for improvement, I guess? Right. But how
does that relate to this relapse thing that you\'re talking about? Well,
I imagine that with bigger wins, it would be more persuasive to myself
and probably more persistent. Yeah. Yeah. That might be that, that\'s
kind of what we\'d be hoping for. We don\'t know that for a fact. But
that\'s, that\'s, that\'s the reason we\'re doing this. Of course, do,
do a role reversal. Okay. So I\'m negative Spencer. Well, you know,
you\'re, your, the reason they didn\'t text you back is probably because
they\'re not interested in hanging out with you anymore. Well, I have
several things to, to mention to you for first, I get tired of your
bullshit. And there\'s really no evidence for that. You know, I\'ve
haven\'t had friends that don\'t want to hang out with me. But certainly
I\'ve screwed up at times and we\'ll screw up in the future. And I
won\'t always be saying the correct thing. And, and I think in a good
relationship, there\'s room for, for screwing up and for, hurting each
other\'s feelings. And sometimes talking those things over can make
relationships closer and, and, and better. But, but there, there is, you
know, one person who definitely has abandoned me. Who\'s that? That,
that\'s your bullshit. You\'re always talking in my ear or trying to put
me down. Cut it out. I\'m tired of you. Nice. Okay. Who won? Well,
definitely a posis dancer won that one. Uh-huh. Was that bigger, small,
bigger, bigger, huge, uh, somewhere between big and huge, I\'d say.
Okay. Let\'s do a real reversal back and see if we can, um, keep pushing
it up higher. One thing I noticed is that you kind of addressed it at
multiple levels. And I think that\'s what I didn\'t do. I just addressed
it like one narrow level. Yeah. Yeah. That\'s right. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. You can come at these things from a number of angles. But, um, the
Spencer, you know, the, your, your, your friend hasn\'t called, called
you back. And, uh, you, you may have hurt, hurt his, his feelings and,
uh, uh, and he\'s probably gonna, gonna abandon you. Well, first of all,
it\'s really common that people don\'t call back for a few days. It
happens all the time. It doesn\'t really mean anything at all. Second of
all, you have a strong relationship with this person, even if they were
annoyed at you, it could be an opportunity to make a relationship even
stronger by working through it with them. And it\'s very unlikely to end
your relationship. And even if it did end your relationship, you have so
many other people that care about you that you have strong relationships
with that you\'d be completely fine. Um, but the reality is that you
spend so much time with worrying about this and it almost never is
actually the case that anything\'s wrong. Okay. Who won? Positive
Spencer. Bigger small. Say big. Bigger huge. Yeah. Big. Sure. That\'s
right. Do do a role river. Well, now let me ask you a question here. Um,
maybe you don\'t want to get to huge on this one. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Well,
there\'s that, there\'s that, I, I want to have that opening that I do
make mistakes that I will sometimes screw things up. I will sometimes
have offended someone and I don\'t, I want to leave that open, right?
Like, it won\'t fully close that possibility. Okay. Now, now what rating
do you give yourself adding that piece in that\'s called the acceptance
paradox? Well, it feels like that helps close the gap, right? Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Like, there\'s that you want to leave that opening, uh, or
like, I want to leave the opening that I could be in the wrong. Yeah.
And so I don\'t want to go to 100% and, you know, just blow the
completely out of the water because everyone\'s so well, that nagging
voice will be right. Yeah, I love that. That\'s, that\'s, that\'s,
that\'s great. And, and you just say, and they\'ll always be screwing up
in my life. And my screw ups is something that can be opportunities to,
to grow and to get closer to people. Absolutely. My problem isn\'t my,
my problem isn\'t my screw ups. My problem is listening to your
bullshit. Okay. I\'m, are you ready for another attack? I\'m ready.
Yeah. You know, you know, Spencer Burns is trying to get you into some
kind of ridiculous bullshit. But the fact is, uh, don\'t listen to him
because you might have hurt or, or upset your friend. First of all, I\'m
tired of your bullshit. You\'re telling me this way too often. Second of
all, I\'m really good at taking criticism and building relationships
with friends where they can bring things up if they do feel hurt. And so
if they actually are feeling bad about our interaction, very likely,
I\'ll find out about it. Third, even if they were hurt and I didn\'t
find out about it, there\'s very high likelihood that our relationship
would still be great in the end. They\'d get over it after a little
while and we\'d still be able to get along well together and they\'d
forgive me. And even in the worst case scenario where this person did
abandon me, I would still have so many other wonderful people in my life
that I\'d be totally fine. But I will leave open the possibility of
being wrong. I\'ll keep that 10% in mind. So you don\'t have to keep
bugging me with it because I am already aware of it. Okay, who won? Uh,
positive Spencer. Bigger small. Big, that\'s a big. Bigger huge. Uh, say
between big and huge, I think that was stronger. Yeah, what did you do
that made it stronger? I think it was just felt more confident. It felt
more self-assured and assertive, I guess. Yeah, I thought of one
dimension, I know if it\'ll help it, but try another, try another role
reversal. All right, are you negative Spencer again? Or is positive?
I\'ll be the positive again. Okay, great. I thought it was pretty darn
close to huge, but there\'s one little gap that we might be able to fail
at. So you know Spencer, your friends are eventually going to ultimately
abandon you. And you know, if someone doesn\'t text you back for a few
days, that\'s a sign that they might be about to never respond to you
again. And you should spend all your time trying to figure out what went
wrong, how you fucked up. Well, I\'m fucking up right now by listening
to you. Let\'s start out with that one. And in the second place, I\'d
like to say that that\'s very unlikely. I\'m really great at taking
criticism. And if I did say something that hurt, hurt someone\'s
feelings, we, we\'d undoubtedly talk about it. And, and, and, and loving
each other more. That they, I don\'t need to be afraid of raw spots and
relationships. That\'s a part of life. But you, you\'ve often told me
this ridiculous thing that, you know, someone\'s going to abandon me
because I said something in the hurt their feelings. If, if that
happened, that, that would be show that there was something very
sensitive in that person that I was not aware of that would be very
unusual for a friend to, to, to take that, that behavior. And so I might
let the dust settle for, for a bit. And then get back to them and just
say, I\'ve been missing you. And clearly, I said something that, that
hurt you a lot. I don\'t even, I\'m doubly cursed because I don\'t even
realize what I did that hurt you so much. But if you\'d be open to it,
I\'d, I\'d love to, to get together and talk to you and tell you how
much I, I love you and care about you and find out what way I screwed up
and, and, and, and see the truth in your, in, in, in your criticism. So
would, would you be open to doing something like that? And that, that\'s
the way I would, that\'s the way I would, would handle it. So, although
that\'s unlikely to occur, that could conceivably occur. And it would
just let me know that I had among my many, pretty robust friends,
someone who\'s, who\'s awfully, awfully, maybe fragile and, and, and,
and vulnerable. And I could still offer support to, to that person.
Yeah, I think that\'s a really good element to bring in because
there\'s, there\'s this issue of responsibility, right? That if
someone\'s upset, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that I\'m in the wrong.
And I think my brain jumps to blaming myself for it. Sure. Sure. Let me
show you another way. Say, say, if, if, if someone\'s upset, it shows
you\'re in the wrong. Say that to me. If someone\'s upset, it means that
you fucked up, and it\'s your fault. I think there\'s a lot of truth in
that. You know, I may have done it, because I was mad at somebody and
kind of lashed out at them, or I might have said something that
inadvertently hurt their feelings. But I can, I can tell them that I
want to hear what they have to say and learn from them and find out the,
the, the way I screwed up. I\'ll be screwing up for the rest of my life.
But, you know, I, I do have one big screw up though, that I\'m going to
try to get over today. Oh, yeah, what\'s that? Listening to your
horseshit constantly chattering in my ear, get the fuck out of here.
It\'s, it\'s so funny to me because it\'s so different than the like, I
don\'t know if you\'re familiar with like, they do have like internal
family systems where you treat every kind of voice in your head as with
kindness and compassion and, you know, as though all the, the concerns
are valid and, and your approach is so different from that, it makes me
laugh. Yeah. Who won that one? How did that work for you? Uh, yeah,
well, I, I liked that. I think, uh, certainly positive Spencer won that
one. Yeah, bigger, small, big, bigger, huge. I\'d say huge, yeah. Huge.
How did I get to huge? Well, I feel like you accepted the, the, you
know, droplet of truth and droplet of wisdom in that, but also dismissed
the voice at the same time. Yeah, yeah. And that\'s the, and I think
that\'s the difference with, with getting to huge, the acceptance
paradox. Right. And then that might be the, the thing for you to, to, to
work on in terms of getting to your next level of enlightenment because
you said that earlier, and are recording too, a little bit that, uh, you
know, if someone criticizes you, you, you know, you don\'t have to let
that upset or maybe that\'s a reflection on them. And I go in the
opposite direction, say that\'s always a reflection on me and to some
degree, but without that, that issue of, of blame to, to, you know, use
the disarming technique and see the truth in their criticism. And that
will generally dissolve the, the, the conflict and it, and whether or
not it does, it, it, it, it gives you a lot more power when you can
incorporate the acceptance paradox into your response. But at any rate,
I know it\'s getting late and, and I just want to tell you one more
thing. Mm-hmm. You should have done better. Well, I think I, I think I
do a really good job, uh, building friendships that are deep and
lasting, the last majority of the time. Of course, I have big mistakes.
Of course, I sometimes screw things up, uh, but I think I do a good job
of learning from those mistakes from listening to the critiques that
people have trying to get better from them. But most importantly, shut
the hell up. Yeah, great. Who won? Uh, positive Spencer. And, and, and
bigger small. Big. Bigger huge. I think pretty huge. Yeah, getting,
getting closer. Well, that\'s, that\'s my assessment is, is that, uh,
going a little further into, into acceptance. Uh, if we could, could,
could, could bring you to the level of, of greater, uh, happiness,
you\'ll always have times of slipping back. But if the, the, the
greatest thing that holds people back is working too much on
self-defense and not, not on, not on, on, on acceptance. Just, just,
let\'s, let\'s do, just a little final exercise here. And then I know
that I\'ll demonstrate some acceptance. Just start ripping into David.
Just save anything you want. Just horrible. Things true, true or false.
Just, you know, David, you\'re, you\'re overhyping your therapy.
There\'s no way you can really cure people in two hours. You\'re
self-deluded. Oh, just one one at a time. All right. Sorry. Okay. So,
sorry. Well, first of all, I, I, let\'s take that I\'m overhyping my, my
therapy. Uh, that\'s, that\'s, that\'s absolutely true. And that
irritates a lot of people too. It\'s that, I have a lot of flaws. That,
that\'s, that\'s just one of many flaws. If you knew me better, you\'d
see I, I, I have a lot of, a lot of things. I screw up in all, all kinds
of ways. So I have to plead guilty as, as accused. Do you, do you
actually believe that? Do you feel that when you\'re saying that? Yeah,
it\'s true. It, it\'s not, it\'s, it\'s, it\'s, it\'s, yet I, I, I do
see almost everyone get a elimination of symptoms in a, in a two hour
therapy session. But so that, that part isn\'t overly high, but I, I, I
really promote my, my therapy and, and a lot of people like that and a
lot of people hate that, but it\'s, it\'s generally better to be humble
than to be overly hyping things. It\'s, it\'s, it\'s, I genuinely
believe that that\'s an error that I made it all the time. I probably
made it a lot on your show. Try again. You know, you accused the
psychologist says being cult leaders, who\'s to say you\'re any
different? Are you just pushing your own paradigm? So it\'s better than
everyone else\'s? Isn\'t that what every say, you know, big psychologist
has done? Yeah, absolutely. I plead guilty as, as accused there too. I,
I, I\'m trying to move the field to a science of psychotherapy, data
driven, so measuring things at the start andegt of every session and,
and, and, and, and getting ratings from patients on empathy and
helpfulness. I think that\'ll, that\'ll make a lot of people honest. And
I think that\'s an important contribution to the field. And I don\'t
have much respect for people who, who don\'t use measurement and
testing. But at the same time, I, I, I do have kind of a cult following
that, that, that\'s for, for sure. And, and I tell myself, God, you\'re,
you\'re no better than the, than the, than the rest. And I think
that\'s, that, that\'s true. I\'m very narcissistic and I have a big
ego. It\'s actually helped me because I\'m not that bright. So I\'ve
worked so hard because of my, of my narcissism. And I have made a lot
of, a lot of discoveries. But yes, you know, I, I\'m also kind of a kind
of a cult leader. I, I, I do research. I spend 10, 15 hours a week doing
analyzing data from our, from our app and seeing what\'s good about it.
What\'s not, we\'re, where\'s, it\'s falling short. So I give myself a
lot of credit for integrity too. But yet, but yes. And, and I kind of, I
love being a cult leader. In fact, if we do another episode, I want to
do it in video and so I can wear robes and sit with flowers around me.
So how did I do? I think you did great. Well, you did a great job of, of
accepting the criticism and not trying to deny it, right? And not trying
to deny it. Yeah. Yeah. And why should we have to deny anything? You
know what I mean? Give me a harsher one. Give me a harsh criticism.
You\'re giving me, so easy, easy. Really? Oh, man. All right. Well, you
know, throughout your career, you must have let down hundreds or even
thousands of people who came to you, thinking you were their last hope.
And, and yet, you know, you didn\'t help them. Yeah. Especially early in
my career, there were a lot of people I helped and, and a lot of people
who, you know, fired me. They, they were turned off by me. I was too
enthusiastic. And even to, to this day, even, you know, recently, you
know, a couple of colleagues got pissed off at me and then I was very
upsetting. I did, I hardly slept last night to tell you the truth. And
we had a great conference just before the call and kind of work, work
things out, which was a great relief to me. But ever since I\'ve been
little, even my parents used to tell me, David, you\'re really hard to
get along with. And they were right. And so I\'m just grateful that
there have been so many that I\'ve been able to help. And, and I\'m
grateful that my skills have evolved and I\'ve been able to develop
levels of compassion that I never had when I was, when I was younger and
coccier. But I, I feel all the time, not only, you know, the, the
patients I work with, but, you know, the family that I love, my son, my
daughter, my, my wife, you know, I, I love them a lot. But I\'ve, I\'ve
failed all of them in many ways. And I\'m just, you know, think it\'s
kind of a miracle that so many people seem to still like me in spite of
all of my failures. And it seems kind of like, like a, a miracle. I have
so many people in the, in the Tuesday group. I, I think the fact that I,
I treat everyone for free and I teach for free. I, I figure that gives
me a little slack there. So they can\'t say, well, you\'re not worth the
money type of thing. But, but, but yeah, I\'m, I have, I\'m a very, very
flawed person on, on, on many, all kinds of levels. Well, David, I just
wanted to thank you so much for coming out. This has been really amazing
conversation. Thank you, thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Thanks
so much, Spencer. You\'re, you\'re really awesome. And, and I had high
expectations for being on your show. And it was, you\'re even better
than that. So thank you so much. I really appreciate you. Thank you,

meaning of life? For my point of view, life doesn\'t have an objective
meaning. So there\'s not quote A meaning of life. Meaning is an emotion
that human tab or an experience of human tab. We can have a sense of
something being meaningful. And when you think of it that way as an
experience to human tab, then lots of things can be meaningful and it\'s
going to differ from people. But for many people, things that are
meaningful, love and building relationships, having children is
meaningful for a lot of people, having projects that have ends that they
really care about or that push them to their limits or challenge them.
Those are the things that people tend to find meaningful. And if you
think that meaning is not objective property of things, but rather an
experience, a human experience or experience of conscious beings, then I
think there\'s lots of things that are meaningful.
