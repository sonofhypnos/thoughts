- What are we addressing in this post? 
- One paragraph Idea? TLDR?
If we want to do germline engineering, we need to identify paternally and maternally important imprinted regions. 

*TLDR: I looked into what we know  order to reduce unknowns unknowns when it comes to how imprinting works in early human embryo. Notice: We can distinguish cases where UPD is heterozygous and monozygous and this would tell us if it is a problem or not!* 

This post assumes basic familiarity with epigenetics. Reading [these](https://denovo.substack.com/p/what-is-epigenetics) [two](https://denovo.substack.com/p/epigenetics-of-the-mammalian-germline) excellent posts (together probably a 20minute- 1h read) contain everything worth knowing for this post. If you know what DNA-Methylation and imprinting are, you can skip the posts. 

The short explanation is that dna-methylation are small chemical marks on the DNA that change what proteins bind well to the dna. Imprinting is a phenomenon where the two sets of chromosomes in early mammal embryos behave differently depending on if they were inherited from the father or the mother side. One, but not the only, way how this is working is through DNA-methylation marks. 

One of the earliest ways how we discovered imprinting is through disorders like [Prader-Willi-syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome), which at that point had already been linked to deletions of some genes on Chromosome 15. Some patients though did not have any such deletions. Instead, they had inherited both of their chromosome 15 copies from their mother. This is usually called maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). 

Uniparental disomies (UPDs) (cases where a child has a chromosome from their parents twice) are an excellent way to identify problems that could be caused by imprinting. UPDs are most often caused by "rescued" trisomies: trisomies that get accidentally corrected by an error during chromosome segregation, turning 1 cell disomic and the other one tetrasomic for that specific chromosome. The more healthy disomic cells then outcompete the aneuploid cell, such that the embryo is completely or mostly made up of euploid cells (aneuploid cells tend to form the placenta instead) [TODO: add reference to figure and add figure]. The other way trisomies can develop is if sperm and eggs are accidentally disomic and nullisomic in the same chromosome, cancelling out each other's mistakes.

where during the development of the early embryo, accidents during chromosome segregation during mitosis leads to a subset of healthy cells again.


Symmetrically inheriting both chromosomes 15 from one's father leads to [Angelmann Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelman_syndrome). 

In the same way, we discovered imprinting for a few other chromosomes. Most notably Silver Turner syndrome, which can be caused maternal UPD on chromosome 7, 11 or 20. Paternal UPD 11 leads to [Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckwith%E2%80%93Wiedemann_syndrome). 

It turns out, after these more common cases, uniparental disomy cases are a lot less often reported.

One question that was still unclear to me after looking up all the known imprinting disorders, was to which extent we even know all the "lethal" or highly detrimental imprinting regions (Something that would not go undetected even if the disease is rare). For example, it could be that one of the rare uniparental disomy cases is so deadly already in early pregnancy that we never observed any cases. We would still have caught any such imprinting regions if they also exist in mice, but for any important imprints missing in mice or if they happen to be less of a problem in mice, UPD would be one of the very few ways we could observe them.

It turns out it is the latter with some caveats. There are two main sources of evidence making me believe this.

The first one is this website maintained by Thomas Liehr which fairly comprehensively gathered together most (all?) [existing case studies of UPD](https://cs-tl.de/DB/CA/UPD/0-Start.html). I manually went through all the database entries and for most chromosomes I was able to find full UPD cases that did not show any symptoms. 

The first one is this graph, which looks at pairs of parents and their chidlren n




We have made some headway, especially in mice, to uncover regions on the genome that are imprinted. Some of the regions that are imprinted in mice are also imprinted in humans and this is historically one way how we have discovered them in humans.











After looking into this, it seems that for the majority of chromosomes, we can in fact find asymptomatic cases (note against this seems a bit of a coincidence that 3 independet fatherhood tests noticed for chromosome 2 that there is imprinting (there should be a lot for chromosome 16 or it is in fact coincidence)).
