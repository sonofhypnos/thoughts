When I was learning chemistry in high school, I used to have a very allergic reaction to it. Compared with physics, all these rules that are broken half of the time were so unsatisfying. Also there were all kinds of ways how we were supposed to write formula's etc. in ways that my chemistry teacher did not always have the patience to explain to me in detail. 
I got the impression that sometimes there were these arbitrary conventions. 

What I maybe suspected, but didn't really forsee, is that a lot of these
conventions were intentionally chosen in ways that should make it easier to
learn more advanced chemistry. My current suspicion is that things like
functional groups are actually carefully chosen groups by chemists, because
chemicals sharing functional groups share a lot of the same chemical traits.
Past me didn't "trust" chemists enough to believe they would have invented
abstractions worth learning. It also seemed to past me like it was just too many
rules that you would have to learn by rote. Now I would view this as an
excellent example where learning by rote and cristalized intelligence is quite
useful and the language for chemistry is actually much better optimized than
natural language to peek into how parts of our world work.

I think past me didn't intuitively feel comfortable learning these rules that I knew were going to be broken and justified not retaining that knowledge where me now see's such leaky abstractions as essential.
