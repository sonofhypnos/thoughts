This document is for small ideas similar to the lw shortform feature

-   Keyboard shortcuts are great. But figuring out how to set them well
    for applications or across applications I care about is really
    annoying.
    -   I now have a [keyboard
        map](https://github.com/sonofhypnos/my-keyboard-layout/tree/main)
        to document my current layout for window-manager shorcuts
    -   How do I manage collisions between english and German keyboards?
        -   Problematic keys: \"\[\", \"\]\", \"\\\" and \"/\" are
            accessible without a modifier key on english keyboards and
            key combinations involving them tend to not work with a
            german keyboard layout
    -   What my current setup looks like (and how this factors into
        things)
        -   Operating system
            -   Browser/Firefox
                -   Trydactyl (for vim keybinds and much more inside the
                    browser)
                    -   webapps
                    -   specific websites
            -   Text-Editor
            -   Other Applications
    -   Different platforms have different keyboard shortcut philosophy
        sets.
        -   VSCode vs Emacs vs. Vim
    -   Example: Different
    -   Story:
    -   link: gwern has an interesting take on this.
