[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Using GPT-4 for personal capability enhancement [[blog]{.smallcaps}]{.tag tag-name="blog"} {#using-gpt-4-for-personal-capability-enhancement}
==============================================================================================================

Inspired by Gwern's article on Google search. I set up a Scratch window
in i3, so now I have gpt4 just 2 simultaneous keypresses away.

I feel like it is really nice to use GPT-4 to ask it about interpersonal
stuff. \"GPT-4 I want to tell my supervisor X or I am considering
writing Y how do you think this will come across\". You think it\'s a
good idea? It\'s also really nice for writing one-off plotting code in
python and things along those lines. Things I haven\'t tried yet so far,
but would be interested to hear from others, is using gpt-4 as sort of
my personal coach/trainer. Like if I tell gpt-4 in it\'s base prompt
what kinds of things I might get distracted by it can get me back on
track when it notices I am distracted (Yeah this sounds insane.) I also
wonder how well gpt-4 might get at giving me challenging+engaging
problems. Like I could ask gpt-4 to give me some for me solvable problem
out of a subject area that I only understand on a shallow level (say
evolutionary biology) and then gpt-4 could prompt me on some proplem
that leads deriving some important quantity in that field. One thing I
find really annoying is that I don\'t have full-text search history for
my chats with gpt-4. It feels I also feel like I am not really
integrated into

Since then I have wondered what other people

-   Having GPT-4 very accessible has been an interesting experience.
    -   very useful for throwaway plotting code.
    -   If there\'s an established method and gpt-4 knows about it,
        great! complicated formulas? Easy
-   I do feel like I have been a bit too tempted to outsource some very
    easy for loops to gpt-4 and I actually don\'t like that part that\'s
    like making me weaker?
    -   or at least if it is not coding better than me
    -   I actually wonder in how far gpt-4 can already be used for
        coaching and pushing myself (keeping me in the ). Like having
        the combination of text-books, wikipedia and chat-gpt to learn
        some stuff about particle physics felt interesting. Although not
        a lot came from that
-   gpt-4 for anki (how to make convenient)
-   inconvenient is that I don\'t have clear file search for my emacs
    stuff
-   Actually it seems like semantic search for all of my files on my
    computer could be viable now!

How can I use GPT-4 and related models to actually be more productive?
How can I use it to push myself?

-   I can ask gpt-4 to ask me math questions and perhaps if I always
    give it 5 minutes and then it gets feedback from me it might
    actually get good at
-   giving me questions that are productive for me.
    -   How well do I expect gpt-4 to be effective there if well
        prompted compared to a good tutor I might have access to?
        -   This seems actually like a very important question. If
            there\'s a way to get an A tutor out of gpt that would be
            really useful
-   Ask other people how they use gpt-4 for munchkinism like this.
-   I can use gpt-4 as a constant translator on topics that I do not yet
    know stuff about.
-   One thing were I feel there is a lot of untapped potential is having
    gpt-4 directly at my cursor sometimes?
-   I also get frustrated, because at least when just using the chat
    interface, there\'s just a single prompt I use.
    -   Like usually I tell gpt-4 to be really informal with me, but
        that is counterproductive if I want it to correct my spelling.
-   I also feel like I want to get better at the sort of \"quickly
    testing hypotheses thing\" that neel is sometimes talking about
    (TODO: this is an instance where it would be nice to have the
    semantic search to find that comment)
