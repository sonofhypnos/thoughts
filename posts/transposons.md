- There is one transposon in us humans that is 6K basepairs long and various fractions of that transposon make up 17% of the human genome
- By now we have sequencing technology to get a good deeply sequenced genome from a single human for ~20-25K including transposons. The frequency that this is done is tiny! (I feel like I want to just go to one of these companies and tell them that I want to pay 10K and want the highest possible coverage I can get for that for my genome in raw data and then I just let whomever do the actual analysis! Would I provide a lot of marginal value there?)
