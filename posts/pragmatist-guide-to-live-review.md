I will not give an all encompassing review of this book.

Structure
---------

### Summarizing the whole book seems not worth the readers time in comparison to just reading the excellen summary by the authors does this sound like an advertisement of the book?

### summarize each of the four sections individually and give your commentary.

Summary
-------

### Practical Scout Mindset combined with tips on how to get what you want

1.  Implicitly Scoutmindset

### This book is aimed at people already buying the claims. They don't spend a lot of time convincing people sometimes.

### Offence as a signal that you are in soldier mindset? (Maybe that is a better way to think about it?). I think there are cases where I would say I was clearly angry/in soldier mindset, but I would not say I was "offended".

Intro (Write intro first or not?)
---------------------------------

### Comparison with the Sequences?

1.  Partially feels like CFAR content, but also really different in some
    aspects. (how do you characterize this difference?).

2.  This book is sort of weird and addresses the questions in a
    nonstandard way by directly confronting the reader?

### Author background and stuff?

1.  I stumbled upon the authors through the Clearerthinking Podcast. The
    authors seem very affiliated with rationalist ideas while never
    explicitly mentioning them in their book.

2.  Impression Podcast

    1.  On the Podcast I got the impression like Malcolm is trying to
        build a community similar to

### Why I read this book/Why others might be interested in the content

1.  Podcast/How the book was advertised to me?

### Whom I would recommend the book?

### Key assumption

So the key assumptions this book is making, is that viewing your life a
one big optimization problem (though they don't call it that
specifically) is a good way to view your life

Content
-------

### Key claims/what is it about on a high level

### The Details

1.  Great summary so you don't actually have to read the whole book

2.  Define your Objective Function

    1.  This is like a ethics 101 section and while I was right in my
        impression that this

    2.  Thought experiments (give examples)

        1.  Examples

            1.  Would you go into a flask that gives you perfect
                happiness/euphoria whatever your preferred ultimate
                emotional state () while leaving the outer world
                completely behind

            2.  Would you kill people who you think have negative lives
                in total

    3.  Taking seriously

        1.  Reminder to take them seriously (there's a slatestarcodex
            thing about that)

        2.  This actually helped me not to get tripped up a few times

    4.  My problems with the thought experiments

        1.  I think my biggest problem with the thought experiments was
            that while the authors where highlighting that you might be
            valueing different things, a lot of their thought
            experiments were set up in a way to disproove/challenge the
            notion that their might only be this one weird trick/thing
            you value. I think this could be something that could trip
            up readers who are not really careful coming away with the
            impression that actually nothing has value which I don't
            think is what the authors believe although I'd estimate to
            have some disagreements/non-shared confusions about what has
            real value. (I don't really try to find an easily to cache
            out answer (does stating value is complex seem like an
            escape))

            1.  For example they were asking whether I would be willing
                to kill people who I estimate to have negative lives.

                1.  Maybe I just have a particular problem with changing
                    peoples live (e.g.) train experiment, but I might
                    still for example want to give them a pill that
                    makes their state less negative that is also
                    shortening their live at the same time.

                2.  -\> Thus I am able to disvalue live vs happiness
                    under some circumstances. I am not quite sure
                    whether this experiment implies that I should be
                    happy to kill people who are unhappy (Though unhappy
                    me would probably agree if there were no hope).

                3.  I can honestly see depressed me disagreeing with
                    that and there is nothing I have to say to him
                    except that my thought processes are the product of
                    a very similar brain that just had some time do
                    develop and that 11 year old me could not have
                    imagined that there could be lives with a happy
                    overlay state.

                4.  I honestly mostly came away from this section with
                    the impression that most lives just aren't
                    negative, but I might be wrong about that.

    5.  This section is trying to lead you through

    6.  Personal relation

        1.  I had been looking forward to this section, because it
            recently came to my attention that I am confused when
            thinking about things like biostasis/cryopreservation and I
            think this section also made me refresh some thoughts and
            highlight areas where I am the most confused.

3.  Your ideological tree

    1.  In order to achieve your objective function, you need an
        accurate map of the territory.

        1.  The authors call these their ideological trees.

    2.  Everyone knows "some" intelligent seniors who seem to have
        been stuck in the past (Examples?). In the analogy of an
        ideological tree these people have a withering tree

    3.  When the authors say ideology what they mean is a
        hypothesis/theory for how the world works.

    4.  Elementary, didn't take away from it

    5.  What I did like is that I came away with a vivid justification
        for why you would want to challenge your beliefs (reference to
        other review).

    6.  I think this was the only section where I felt I took away
        nothing from as it was too elementary. Though I've seen myself

4.  Defining your identity

    1.  It basically makes a convincing case why you should be really be
        careful what you identify as, not only for obvious things like
        discussing god, but more subtle things, like not even
        considering options because they don't seem like the kind of
        thing your conception of yourself would do.

    2.  I think in general rationalists are less prone to this failure
        mode, because we like to justify everything we do, but I do see

        1.  Example:

            1.  Not proactively meeting people because I am a safe kinda
                person

5.  Defining your public character

    1.  I feel like I actually needed this convincing case

    2.  Flaws in your character

        1.  Thing on presidents I don't buy

What I liked
------------

### Actually trying to win while avoiding standard self help! Trying to offend you! (Definetly be causes for some people?)

### Showing not telling

1.  The book never explicitly talks about the principles that make up
    good reasoning, but instead just use them and expect the audience to
    believe this is the right way to go about thisngs.

    1.  I think this book is trying to teach you self-honesty 301 while
        not even teaching you basic probability.

### Thinking through the stuff in the book

1.  This was definitely something enhanced by writing the review

### The Concept Handles!

1.  Objective function

    (already knew the term, but so far I had taking infinite recursion
    of reflection as my way of referencing this, but I will use
    objective function from now on due to simplicity which I feel like
    it might help to identifying bugs in my behaviour)

    1.  Example: I was standing in front of a traffic light at 1pm on a
        completely void street the other day, and I was immediately
        thinking (is this in line with my objective function?) (Though I
        won't distract with my conclusion here.)

        most people would probably find this behaviour weird even though
        I don't particularly mind, but if the only reason I do this is
        for how it looks for other people and is not actually " (flag
        rationalization)

2.  ideological tree

3.  overlay states

4.  Keeping identity small as a checklist

    1.  Feels like the perfect things to add to my buglist.

5.  offence as signal

    1.  I am not sure this has truly made me identify stuff. But I think
        there are some areas where I noticed that my mind really didn't
        like to go and to confront them that I didn't otherwise:

        1.  frugality

        2.  rule abiding

            (not sure this is just actually justified, but questioning
            it might instead of running on autopilot might be good
            idea.)

        3.  Sexuality

            I did not deliberately consider whether I would want to be a
            relationship/timelines on this stuff/when to prioritize
            it/whether being in love would actually serve my utility
            function

6.  bayseanism/Popperian

    1.  This one is never namedropped, but he always stresses to look
        for the evidence that would disproof ones theory

    2.  The Bayseans might disagree, but I often still think of it this
        way for simplicity if making up more hypothesis and stuff is not
        worth the effort.

### The practical Sections

1.  Looking inward

### Dense

1.  This is not your average self-help book that is trying to make you
    feel good. I really like the honesty of the authors in many places
    to actually state: "Yes this is hard and if it's not worth your
    time maybe just don't bother" (although they seem to be trying to
    upset you in many places \[grounded in the believe that Offence as a
    detector for ideas to pay attention to\]

    1.  I definitely felt more offended by the relationship guide than
        by the live guide, which felt like an easy but engaging read.

### Writing Style

1.  I liked the writing style (bold, which on the one hand made me
    disagree, but on the other hand way more satisfying as a reader to
    get strong claims sticking out your neck) with added disclaimers
    that weak claims. On the other hand the statements in question just
    sounded so utterly incorrect that I would never have expected them
    to be representing the truth ever.

### High epistemics

### Very particular perspective

What I didn't like
-------------------

### Section wasn't for me personally

### Objective function {#objective-function-1}

1.  This term might be the single

### Namedropping important comcepts and not going further into it.

1.  There were a lot of concepts that were just namedropped in the book
    and then just never addressed again.

2.  On the one hand I see the value in not creating a wrath of technical
    terms this seems to have led out some topics that I like to nerd out
    about (math). I am completely ok with that and it is the reason I
    would feel comfortable recommending this book to non-mathy people I
    know (like my brother). I also feel like this points to a better
    approach in general, because I think learning about things like
    bayseanism in the abstract had less impact on my forecasting/ground
    level reasoning skills compared to just proxis like: what evidence
    would contradict your

    1.  Though things like Occams razor definitely helped me in turning
        from a confused agnostic to a less confused atheist.

3.  Probability

4.  Expected Value

5.  Betting on your beliefs

6.  Belief as anticipation

### Pragmatism was sometimes to pragmatic for my personal tastes, but I feel like it is the kind of content I feel I'd super much like to see more of on Lesswrong

1.  Benefit on the other hand is that I can sell this better to friends
    who I feel would be careful to buy to technical ideas from me (since
    how on earth do they apply to their personal life.)

    1.  Maybe interesting in a sense of Writing convincingly, but
        wrongly

### Now I feel super overwhelmed and feel like to read the next book to get my priorities actually straight again. What areas of my life do I need to actually "kill"
