[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Why you should start to write down notes (somewhere somehow) right now [[blog]{.smallcaps}]{.tag tag-name="blog"} {#why-you-should-start-to-write-down-notes-somewhere-somehow-right-now id="writing-down-things"}

[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Stuff to link to: {#stuff-to-link-to}
-------------------------------------

### TODO

### [TODO]{.todo .TODO} Thing from CGPGrey {#thing-from-cgpgrey}

### [TODO]{.todo .TODO} Thing from the other person who wrote about this stuff {#thing-from-the-other-person-who-wrote-about-this-stuff}

[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Having a log about past self is really interesting (not that good of an argument!) {#having-a-log-about-past-self-is-really-interesting-not-that-good-of-an-argument}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [TODO]{.todo .TODO} Case in point: I would not have noticed, that I have made enormous progress with focusate, if I hadn\'t written down at the time how I wanted to cancel every single session because thinking of the smalltalk you would have to do would be awefull! {#case-in-point-i-would-not-have-noticed-that-i-have-made-enormous-progress-with-focusate-if-i-hadnt-written-down-at-the-time-how-i-wanted-to-cancel-every-single-session-because-thinking-of-the-smalltalk-you-would-have-to-do-would-be-awefull}

1.  [TODO]{.todo .TODO} I feel like I definitely improved on the anxiety
    front, though I don\'t really feel like I\'ve mastered the smalltalk
    front. Maybe I should try to write down more specific notes on how
    every session went? Or is it just normal to have these rough edges
    when you work with someone you don\'t know?

Good example of failed documentation for future self:
-----------------------------------------------------

\[2022-01-20 Do\] Oh my god! I just figured out how to do links in
org-mode and the workflow is amazing and so much better than what I
could have even dreamed off! It is so amazing to use a tool that is made
my people who are just as obsessed (or even more?)with workflows as I
am! (02-02-2022: Thanks past me. Could you have please documented how
exactly one does that?)
