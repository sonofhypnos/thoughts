It turns out the \"wobbly table theorem\" is less of just a math
curiosity than I thought.

The \"wobbly table theorem\" essentially says (ignoring [caveats and
different variants](https://haggainuchi.com/wobblytable.html )) that if
you have a \"table\" with legs of equal length resting on a continuous
surface with three legs touching the ground, you can find a rotation
where the table rests on all four legs. I first encountered this years
ago on [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuF-WB7mD6k).

This investigation started with my frustration with the chair I am
currently sitting on and me thinking that the wobbly table theorem
couldn't apply to my use-case. Surely the chair was too poorly built,
given how wobbly it was! I assumed the floor in the room I'm in to be
relatively flat. But, when I tried turning the chair around, it worked!?

I thought once we have a table where one of the legs is shorter and the
surface is flat, it's obvious that we cannot make the table stable. In
my mind most wobbly chairs I encountered were broken like that (for
example when one of their furniture glides gets lost).

After seeing this, I put the chair on another table (since I expected
the table to be flatter) and it turns out the chair actually has much
flatter legs than I had imagined.

So essentially my assumption that the chair was to blame was incorrect.
In hindsight, I could have checked and realized this earlier.

Right before posting this, I realized that the chair was still to blame,
to some degree. The chair I was sitting on was missing the black
furniture glides at the back (those that you can see in the image
above). So, at the back, the chair was essentially resting on multiple
points out of pretty rigid metal. Switching to a chair with all
furniture glides did in fact make the chair stable in any position I
tried.

I had underestimated how much the problem had been motivated by
[actually touching the
territory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/y7wgtZ2ehfWuqzXfm/direct-observation):
