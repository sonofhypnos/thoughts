- I think a lot of people haven't gotten the update from John wentworths review on Systems biology showing the modularity found in systems made through evolution
- We tend to point out these "funny" failures that Evolution runs into, but actually human systems that are not executing some timeless decision theory.
- I think the sequences might partially be contributing to this. Or in general people who tend to like math and science and engineering, who then stumble over evolution which is then doing everything so differently in "ways that make no sense.". 
  - I think a lot of people tend then to make wrong inferences in the sense that I heard from steven byrnes which was something like "have you considered that the thing you are ridiculing is actually smarter than whatever you would have come up with and it's actually one of the places where evolution found the magic that we as humans have not aquired yet."
  - Like I feel if someone was looking at human society they'd also find all of these "local improvements" that are things that humans would not have found.
  - So part of the problem here is the thing mentioned where very simple evolution simulations have not reached the point where they have optimized themselves to be better at search themselves. That's probably also why the bit-rate with evolution has slowly rizen. Evolution was basically also getting better and better and that is also why we see so many animals converging on being rather smart (check if there are any really old animals that are smart). It seems definitely like smartness is one characteristic that has still lots of gains in evolution
    - What is a prediction made by this model that could be tested?
      - in general, old organisms would be absolutely destroyed by modern ones. It would be interesting though if we sent our modern ones back in time (although of course all the large mammals etc. are gone because we humans absolutely destroyed them.)
      - whales are relatively recent and where probably not as smart to begin with. It is also notable that they are a smart species that sort of strongly switched it's niche quite drastically. Of course probably every time a new species evolves, it is something like that, but in the case of whales it is quite strong.
      - Smartest animals and change in environment:
       - apes already super smart, then radically changed environment
       - parrots also super smart, harder to change environment maybe? Perhaps better food source?
       - It would be interesting if ... could be bread to be more intelligent
