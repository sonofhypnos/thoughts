<!-- NOTE: I might perhaps want to think about how we do things?-->


Recently I've been trying to learn the different regions of the brain by heart. Unfortunately unlike for the globe where people have made really nice maps that make it easy to memorize where different countries lie relative to each other, there is really no good map for the relative placement of different brain regions. There are these images that people who study medicine use to memorize this, but I am not trying to become a neurosurgeon, I don't need to understand the exact placement. I need a map that I can easily navigate and reference in my head. It has to be 2-d!
