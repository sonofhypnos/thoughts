Having a post that is continously updated on what I think about sleep would be cool. Perhaps I could design my website around that. Also sounds like work though. Perhaps there is a relatively easy system with version control?

This strikes me as one of those problems that could be solved with more theory if not the most important one.
I notice that I have other problems where I could have noticed my confusion (Arrows theorem, decision theory, the thing in the databases class (on the ohther hand, was not taking that seriously to begin with?), regular expressions.)
It feels like the type of thing where you might reach a satisfying answer like with laughter. 

What are all the known theories for sleep?
- I didn't try to be comprehensive here (maybe another blogpost), I am just trying to get an understanding here.
- Questions :
  - When did sleep first evolve?
  - How was it relative to brains or other things that could be relevant?
  - What type of sleep phases happen in different animals?
  - Energy theory seems woefully inadequate!
  - Why would more sleep be more beneficial with wolbachia and the other hosts?
    - Is this even a thing? (how large is the effect?) (feels like disadvantage?)
    - Favors females. We would expect asymetry in sleep between males and females (is that true?) (in humans, barely any differences) (generally little differences (in drosophilia, males sleep less and more time searching mates))
  - I don't think the picture with the ... makes real sense
  
    - claude: Sleep: just a gradual shift (metabolic day night thing and then the other stuff?) (perhaps claude is right?)
 
 - What the fuck is up with REM?
   - What type of species have REM?
- Seems like orcas also have really big disadvantages in development, because they need to learn to breath and stuff first, before they can start REM sleep or similar?
- Lol. Orcas are also an exception when it comes to sleep.
- What theories explain sleep debt? That seems confusing on most theories?
- What are some constraints we can put on a sleep theory?
