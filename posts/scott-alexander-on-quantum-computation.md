How this relates to my recent adventure:
----------------------------------------

I\'ve recently already talked about how to integrate my views of Physics
with quantum mechanics. What I only now realized is how

Scott Alexander on how physics stuff
------------------------------------

-   Busy Beaver Paper
    -   So fascinating!
-   P vs NP
    -   This is excellent and clarifying on so many levels!
-   Another thing that I found fascinating was that scott doesn\'t even
    need to understand that much physics!
-   He can just use the wafefunction abstraction.

### Explain how this connects to your last post

### -\> If someone has to understand all of the consequences of quantum computation, then it is going to be quantum-computation theorists!
