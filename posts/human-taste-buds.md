[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Function of Human taste buds inside the body [[blog]{.smallcaps}]{.tag tag-name="blog"} {#function-of-human-taste-buds-inside-the-body}
===========================================================================================================

My current best guess for the function of different human taste buds:

-   Bitter: your food is poisonous? (also indicating high pH?)
    -   Multiple different kinds of receptors
    -   G-proteins?
-   Sour: your food is acidic
-   Sweet: your food has easily digestible carbohydrates
-   Umami: your food contains glutamate (=\> proxy for protein)
-   Salty: your food contains salt
