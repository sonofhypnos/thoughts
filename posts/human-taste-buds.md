My current best guess for the function of different human taste buds:

-   Bitter: your food is poisonous? (also indicating high pH?)
    -   Multiple different kinds of receptors
    -   G-proteins?
-   Sour: your food is acidic
-   Sweet: your food has easily digestible carbohydrates
-   Umami: your food contains glutamate (=\> proxy for protein)
-   Salty: your food contains salt
